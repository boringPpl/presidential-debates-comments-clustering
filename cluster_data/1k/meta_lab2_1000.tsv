Trump won election the swamp rats in Washington did everything they could to cheat in order to have Biden win. Congrats you now have the power and this country and all we can do is sit around and watch you waste our money change the constitution do whatever they want and clearly I don't see our country strong and proud. This election was a disgrace 75 million people voted for president Trump and the few swing states should be ashamed of themselves for being pushed around to be bullied into being dishonest. No one on Trump side believes for one second that sleepy Joe won.  He is not my president.  I am sad, angry frustrated and upset so pelosi and shumner shame on you.  You have not done 1 thing for the American people. You are the reason we all want term limits because you don't deserve to be in government.   Do us all a favor. Retire	-1

"In 1941 Shoghi Effendi (The Guardian of the Baha’i’ Faith) castigated the prevalent trends of society in no uncertain terms: 
“Although Europe was the cradle of a ""godless"", a ""highly-vaunted yet lamentably defective civilization"",	
the foremost protagonist of that civilization was now the United States and that, in that country, at the present time, its manifestations had led to a degree of unbridled materialism which now presented a danger to the entire world.”"	-1

"47:41 'THEY'RE INTERFEIRING WITH AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY.' ??

What about The United States interfeiring with the sovereignty of countless countries in the Middle-East over the past 20-30 years? How can you not acknowledge that? When it happens to America, it's a big deal. When America does it to other nations, they can get away with it because they are seen as the policeman of the world. This is unconstitutional.

I actually think Trump is a bigger supporter of the constitution. The way he talks about bussinesses going bankrupt and the fact that you can't close down the entire country. He's right. You must advise the American people to protect the elderly and the people with a weak immune-system. You do this by not visiting your grandparents or let's say your friend who has breathing problems. But you cannot shut down an entire economy. Biden constantly says he'll take care of these dying bussinesses but he never says how. Where is the money going to come from? Handing out subsidies sounds simple but it's not right. This usually results to the Federal Government counterfitting money, the value of the dollar goes down and inflation goes up. Eventually the middle class will suffer people lose their jobs and houses. The media is constantly slagging of Trump, but he never urged his supporters to storm the capitol. Biden constantly supported the chaos caused by BLM when bussinesses were burnt down, shops were looted and countless of people were killed. Yet the media doesn't slate him for this. We live in a society were whatever the mainstream media tells you, you have to believe it. You are not entitled to have your own opinion anymore or you get called a racist or an idiot. There are a lot of problems in America and I honestly think the media is making Trump sound worse than he actually is."	-1

URGENT! THE TRUTH ABOUT COVID 19: https://michaelgchandler34blog.wordpress.com/	147
it's crazy how people overlooked what trump said about his son having covid. not only is that not how the virus works but you don't need to show symptoms to spread the virus. this is not only a massive lie but an extreamly dangerous one, thousands of americans have died because this fool refuses to take this outbreak seriously. this is why trump isn't getting a second term. not because of any fraud or media but because he let the American people down and it was all of us who has suffered.	-1

Biden sides with China. Trump is pro dissolving this relationship, what with so many Chinese rooted within the government. So, you are saying China are America's friends? Take a look at how China operates within their own grounds. It's fake communism with their leader abusing power. Sure, all leaders want their countries to be on top but censoring people in favour of advancing their vision is not something that they should be applauded for, let alone having it be accepted. Trump demanded a re-vote in counts which is fucking perfect, when has this been done before? Questioning corruption I mean. I am from Greece, this does not affect me in a lot of ways but mentally. Hopefully people here will take matters into their own hands and at least question our leaders, which btw, are beyond corrupt, even crossing the line of full censorship on ALL channels and giving bad press to individuals who are not even involved directly in this situation. It is hard doing that through full censorship but the bright side is that people are always in the talks. In other words, things are out of control and I wish we had someone like the US president that would speak up and at the very least raise awareness.	-1

Billionaire and genius Jovan H. Pulitzer by far has shown in the simplest terms to Georgia Legislators, the strongest evidence of an organized crime syndicate in the US Government of both elected officials and government workers. Supported by the disgusting hell bound demonic lying criminal media. A complete conspiracy, like Joe Biden confessed on a live internet Interview that he and the democrat party have the most fraudulent campaign in US history. This engineering genius Jovan Pulitzer just showed how republican ballots were printed differently ( all across the US) to cause them to be rejected by the Ballot Scanners controlled by democrats and sent to adjudication machines operated by evil democrats working in secrecy and then switch from Trump to Biden while the evil democrats destroyed many of the original ballots. This is what the evidence shows; the democrats stealing an election and country with all its wealth and weapons with the power and stated intention to prosecute the opposing political party. Democrats boldly lie, , cheat , steal, bare false witness, point the finger with false charges while conspiring and doing the actual crime. Speaker Nancy and the democrats were falsely attacking President Trump saying he was forcing the US Post Office to do less and slower work on the delivery of voters ballots; while the entire time Speaker Nancy was as part of this proven conspiracy , just pointing away from different ballot markings on the Republican ballots versus the democrat ballots. That’s because Nancy’ s planned steal by mass adjudications, Nancy, the ballot designer, the printer, everyone that approved the ballots the Governors the Secretary of States, the Judges and so many people that saw or knew about the ballot templates (proofs) prior to printing and changing the the laws to cause universal unsolicited mass mail out ballots and changes in time and locations of voting,  along with Dominion were all in on the crime of the Century; but They got caught	-1

"Trump has promoted a number of conspiracy theories that have lacked substance. These have included Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories from 2011. Known as ""birther"" theories, these allege that Barack Obama was not born in the United States.[64][65][66] In 2011, Trump took credit for pushing the White House to release Obama's ""long-form"" birth certificate, while raising doubt about its legitimacy,[67] and in 2016 admitted Obama was a natural-born citizen from Hawaii.[68] He later falsely stated that Hillary Clinton started the conspiracy theories.

I'm from Los Angeles. It really was the most fake vote ever made in America. In the area where I live, everyone voted for Donald Trump and some did not even know Joe Biden. As far as I know, the same thing happened in the whole city. Whoever you asked said that Trump is the best prime minister who really cares about his people. Can anyone explain where the 76% number for biden in my area came from? The biden may not have received even 5 votes. What can I say ... Let me not forget that in the place where the voting took place, those who gave us ballot papers, shouted ALL BIDEN TO VOTE. What is this??? Maybe they did not want a man who supported us for covid 19 and said it as it really should. From what we know from acquaintances and friends in recent days, in many cities in America they did not even take out Trump's ballot. But if you did not vote, you would be fined. I know of another incident where the wife of a friend of mine in Washington, where they received a phone call last night threatening that if Biden did not come out with 32 votes more, HE WOULD LOSE HER JOB. The whole USA wanted Donald to be prime minister again. We know that a major fraud was committed against him.	-1
Joe Biden is not the President.  He has dementia and he needs to stop playing his games with the People of the United States.  Joe gets nothing done and his son is a crook.  Joes wife is not a doctor of medicine.  Time for Joe and his wife and his criminal son to face a trial and go to jail for their crimes.	-1

"\\\\ ARE GEORGIA AND OTHER STATES UNDER GERRYMANDERING DARKNESS? //// Instead of clean election run inside well established county-borders, Gerrymandering people tilt election borders by their ""pre-selected"" racial and other known voting tendencies, as reportedly done at least in Georgia [YOU-tube, Mar 9, 2017],""'Washington,[127], Arizona,[128], California[129], [130] Rhode Island [131], New Jersey [132,133]"" - Wikipedia, and Oct 17, 2019, YOU-tube: ""The man who rigged America's election maps."" To avoid destabilizing tainting of future regimes, well established county borders should be used to remove doubts regarding the Nov-3-run to be compared with a clean general runoff. No time? WRONG. The original constitution: Four months post election date. as done over hundred years until president FDR changed it in 1932. Naturally some would object, but what is more important?..\\\\"	-1

People are arguing all over local social media's around the world on who is better Joe Biden or Donald Trump truth be told I think that Donald Trump was a horrible mistake and for the 2020 election there were two horrible people running for president so we had to vote for one and we choose Joe Biden and that's final Donald Trump can keep on arguing saying that the elections were rigged and everything but even if we were to have another election there is a very low possibility that Donald Trump would win so we should just wait until Joe Biden's reign to end to decide if he's a good president or not so let's not judge him when he has just became president ( A lot of people are gonna hate me for this (～￣▽￣)～ )	-1

But when you believe the words of the world government's bitches who are just on the stage quoting stone age history, thats when the rest of us understand why you guys are the dumbest. Why dont you try learn a few things from the East maybe it will make the obese nation built on genocide and rape ""great"" again. We are all slaves but if we side with the elite's attempt to use our obsession with patriotism then what? Then you have failed as a human being. A hungry family is a hungry family. Put the guns down and use your brains for once. Wake up and demand change you trigger happy money freaks. We cannot evolve if we dont aim to acknowledge that WE ARE ONE RACE.

Donald Trump for four years you’ve been doing things horrible for the country so don’t say that you ran for president because of how bad Biden is when you said that Barack Obama and Joe Biden did not do anything for the country of course they did they were president and Vice President at least Biden has a good way to protect us from COVID-19 when you’re saying that Biden will close down the country as you’re not that smart and you’re saying that just to be a bully and you want more people to vote for you instead of him he’s a nice guy he’s smart just respect people I can’t wait for you to get out of office	-1

No one on this planet is to blame for this horrible Virus to hit us all....but the true colours of a caring President would be to immediately get everyone together who can advise him on all aspects on actions to take! As of my writing,thank god Trumpy has been booted out as from January 20th 2021 and this gentleman,Mr Joe Biden..President Elect.. will do everything he can to reboot America,to heal the wounds of the jobless,to act on poverty....and make America a great country as it’s always been before Trumpy got his dirty hands on it! 
Nobody is perfect....no one,but Joe is a normal thinking,caring human being who will do all he can to make good where it’s needed! God bless you Americans...fret not...help is coming your way very soon!"	-1

"In my personal opinion, All the candidates are not the best person for the job. But we're all human. So technically no one is. 
All three of those men are getting older and the stress of presidency is not healthy for them some. Bernie Sanders, doesn't know much about politics. He might sound like a nice idea for president on the surface but I don't think in actuality that he'd be right for such a high position. Donald Trump is so egotistical, that's the main thing that makes him a bad president. If he could learn to be more humble, than more people would like him. I think Trump has the passion and nerve to be president along with the willingness to not back down from a fight. However he makes too many rash and impulsive  decisions. Sometimes he has made good ones. But he's personality is his biggest issue overall in office. And as for Joe Biden, He is kinda your typical puppet like president. He isn't bad, but he isn't great either. Biden has more of the political knowledge that we might need in the white house, however I worry he will be submissive to congress at times when he shouldn't be. 
And my last point is this. It doesn't matter who is in office. No one is going to be a president we all can agree on. So just be happy the nuclear bombs haven't killed us yet. Cause any president who makes it out of office without the world ending is a decent one to me."	-1

I am told that Trump basically left me to be attacked- had he done a better job protecting me he would have exposed the look alike of me sooner and once they did find out, that he took no measure to protect me, if he did then he would still be president.
 God Bless Us All and bring us together as the Family that we are.and protect us in the meantime. Thank you to my Brothers who are trying to reach me for the understanding of mineral emissions & Hieroglyphs depicted on the pyramids and temples around the world.
It will waken a true & ancient understanding that is inside us all. To my beloved brothers
Thank you again for being there for me. I assure you that Aaron looks forward to our time ahead and so do I.

"27:16 Trump: “A vaccine will be announced within weeks.”
Righties: “I hope he’s right.”
Lefties: “Liar!”
30:20 Biden: “I will make sure we have a plan.”
Lefties: “That’s my boy!”
Righties: “It is good to plan to have a plan.”
30:32 Trump: “The vaccine isn’t a guarantee but it will be here by the end of the year.” Names Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer. 
Righties: “I hope he’s right.”
Lefties: “Liar!”

Post debate “Fact Checkers” declare Trump’s comments as FALSE. Say all experts disagree. Vaccine won’t be ready until next summer. 

November 8th, Pfizer announces 95% effective vaccine. 
December 14th, first Pfizer vaccine administered. 

So...I guess the President does have access to reliable information after all. Who’d of thunk it? POTUS knows a little more than we do. Amazing. 

Let’s come back here in a few months when all the credit is given to Biden. For the record I give most of the credit to the vaccine makers but it definitely helps to have a President putting you on the spot and pushing you to go as fast as you’re capable of while doing it right at the same time."	-1

I want to give a testimonial on how i was cured of the HIV virus. A few months ago i had some symptoms. I went to see a doctor and they did a lot of blood tests, later they told me i had HIV. My doctor told me there is no cure for HIV and i felt bad,i went online looking for a possible cure for the HIV virus,i saw a post about Dr Eguabor, a herbal doctor who cured someone  HIV. I contacted him and told him how i felt. He said that his herbal medicine can cure me permanently. He sent me the herbal medicine through the courier and i received the herbal medicine a few days after he sent it. I took the herbs as prescribed by him. Before completing the medication, the symptoms ceased. I went to the doctor and had another blood test, surprisingly i was Negative. I have no longer had any symptoms,i am completely cured. You can also get him to help you if you have this virus. He also cures HEPATITIS B,CANCER,AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, GENITAL WARTS INFECTIONS,SIMPLE HERPES VIRUS,DIABETES,STERILITY ULCERS,COVID-19,SICKLE CELLS,etc.He also helps with penis enlargement and helps restore your broken relationship. Contact him by Email:dreguabor@aol.com or Call/WhatsApp on:+2348107439905	140
I have no idea how ANYONE could have voted for Biden after seeing this.  The country needs to see this again, before we swear in Biden.  What has finally come to light, as far as the Biden's family and relations with China, should be enough to have one regretting casting a vote for Biden.	-1

"Bismillahhir rahmannir rahiim.
Dengan Nama Allah Yang Maha Pengasih lagi  Maha Penyayang.

Hai  orang-orang  yang  beriman,  janganlah  kamu  seperti  orang-orang  kafir (orang-orang munafik) itu,  yang  mengatakan  kepada  saudara-saudara  mereka  apabila  mereka mengadakan perjalanan di  muka    bumu    atau  mereka   berperang:  "" Kalau  mereka  tetap bersama-sama kita tentulah mereka  tetap  bersama-sama kita tentulah mereka tidak  mati  dan  tidak  dibunuh"".  Akibat   (dari  perkataan  dan  keyakinan  mereka) yang demikian itu,  Allah  menimbulkan  rasa penyesalan  yang  sangat  di  dalam  hati  mereka.  Allah  menghidupkan  dan  mematikan.  Dan Allah melihat apa yang kamu kerjakan.

Dan sungguh kalau kamu gugur di jalan  Allah  atau  meninggal tentulah ampunan  Allah  dan  rahmat-Nya  lebih  baik  (bagimu) dan harta rampsan yang mereka kumpulkan.

Dan sungguh jika kamu meninggal atau gugur, tentulah kepada Allah saja kamu dikumpulkan.

Maksudnya:  meninggal  di  jalan  Allah  bukan karena peperangan.

Maka  disebabkan  rahmat  dari  Allah-lah  kamu  berlaku  lemah lembut  terhadap  mereka.  Sekiranya  kamu  besikap  keras  lagi  berhati  kasar,  tentulah  mereka menjauhkan diri dari sekelilingmu, Karena  itu  ma'afkanlah  mereka,  mohonkanlah ampun bagi mereka, dan bermusyawarahlah  dengan mereka  dalam  urusan  itu.  Kemudian  apabila  kamu  telah  membulatkan  tekad,  maka  bertawakkallah  kepada Allah.  Sesungguhnya  Allah  menyukai  orang-orang yang  bertawakkal kepada-Nya.

Jika Allah menolong kamu, maka mengalahkan  kamu;  Jika  Allah membiarkan kamu (tidak memberi pertolongan)   maka siapakah gerangan  yang  dapat  menolong kamu (selain) dari Allah sesudah itu?  Karena  itu  hendaklah  kepada  Allah  saja  orang-orang  mu'min bertawakkal.

Tidak  mungkin  seorang  nabi  berkhianat  (dalam  urusan rampasan  perang).  Barangsiapa yang berkhianat  (dalam urusan rampasan perang itu),  maka pada hari  Kiamat  ia  akan  datang membawa apa yang dikhianatkannya itu; Kemudian tiap-tiap diri akan diberi pembalsan tentang apa  yang   ia kerjakan     dengan   (pembalasan)  setimpal,  sedang  mereka tidak dianiaya.

Apakah  orang  yang  mengikuti keridaan  Allah  sama dengan orang yang kembali  membawa  kemurkaan (yang besar) dari  Allah dan tempatnya adalah Jahannam? . Dan itulah  seburuk-buruk  tempat  kembali.

(Kedudukan)     mereka    itu   bertingkat-tingkat  di sisi  Allah, dan  Allah  Maha  Melihat  apa  yang  mereka  kerjakan.

Sungguh  Allah  telah  memberi karunia kepada orang-orang yang beriman ketika  Allah mengutus di antara mereka seorang rasul dari golongan  mereka sendiri,  yang membacakan kepada mereka ayat-ayat Allah,  membersihkan (jiwa) mereka, dan mengajarkan kepada mereka  Al  Kitab dan Al  Hikmah.  Dan  sesungguhnya  sebelum  (kedatangan  Nabi) itu,  mereka adalah    benar-benar  dalam kesesatan yang nyata.

All tares are sentenced to perdition by the authority of the holy spirit and Creator.  All tares, every last one of you, whenever the Creator wants, instantly, and soon, you will be cast into the abyss. There, you will be in utter darkness, and in a state of total delirium. You'll be confused, nauseous, dizzy, feel painfully sick, and your logic and ability to perceive left from right, up from down, won't work anymore. That's because the grace of the Creator which gave you those abilities will be forever gone at that point, much like your free will already is gone now as you serve the satanic hive mind and are a slave to it. There's no time in perdition, so your time there will never end. There is no where you can go in the abyss, because everywhere you walk melts away or circles back on itself. You'll hear the wailings of other tares in there with you, but you won't be able to find them. Sleep is impossible, so is eating or drinking. And yet you'll feel those urges to do those things just as you did in this world. But they will be impossible.	-1

"the White House no longer focused on Otto's tragedy. In fact, it swung so far in the opposite direction that civil-rights groups complained about human-rights issues not being on the agenda for the summit in Singapore. When the three remaining American detainees were released in May, Trump welcomed them home by saying, “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.”  this is what he said, even knowing how south Korea Kim Ong-un tortured and made  like a vegetable  a yuong man of 21 named Otto Warmbie until he died.

Even before than she was being paid 160 thousand per month. Dude is such a manipulative liar... No telling how much he is paying his kids..	-1
you can tell trump is talking out of his ass and when Biden says something tump turns the question on Biden to cover trumps own ass its like watching Eric cartman-trump  Kyle broflovski-Biden  omg they killed Kenny you basted	-1

"AMERICA SENT A FOOL ON AN ERRAND AND HE HAS CUT HER LEGS OFF AND DISPLAYED THE STOMPS

SOON YOUR TONGUE WILL BE BRIDLED. YOU THINK, NOW I TALK. A SCOUNDREL, NUMBNUTS IS A LYING, FOOLISH, AND A FLIGHTY CREATURE. A SIMPLETON WHO CARES FOR NOTHING AND NO ONE BUT HIMSELF. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TREATING US AS CATTLE? ARE WE NOTHING BUT BRUTE BEAST TO YOU? IS THE EARTH A DESERT TO PROVE YOU RIGHT? WHEN A FOOL SPEAKS RUIN IS NEAR. LEWDNESS AND TARDINESS IS SPORT FOR THE STUPID. A GODLESS MAN WHO NEVER LISTENS TO CORRECTION. HATE IS ALWAYS PICKING A QUARREL. BY HIS WORDS THIS GODLESS MAN HAS RUINED MANY OTHERS. LIKE A GOLD RING IN A PIGS`S SNOUT THIS RICH MAN IS WITHOUT COMMON SENSE OR CHARACTER. A CRUEL MAN WHO MAKES TROUBLE, HAS NO RESPECT FOR HIS NEIGHBORS. WHOEVER RELIES ON HIS WEALTH AND PURSUES EVIL IS RIDING FOR A FALL. A MAN IS COMMENDED FOR HIS INTELLIGENCE, BUT A WRAPPED AND CONCEITED MIND IS DESPISED. THIS FOOL THINKS HE IS ALWAYS RIGHT: THEREFORE IS ALWAYS TRAPPED BY HIS OWN FALSEHOODS. DO HE KNOW TRUTH STANDS FIRM FOREVER, BUT LIES LIVE ONLY FOR A MOMENT. A CLEVER MAN CONCEALS HIS KNOWLEDGE, BUT A FOOLISH AND STUPID MAN BROADCAST AND PARADES HIS FOLLY. VIOLENCE IS MEAT AND DRINK FOR THE TREACHEROUS. A BRAINLESS FOOL CAUSES STRIFE BY HIS PRESUMPTIONS. ILL FORTUNE FOLLOWS A SINNER CLOSE BEHIND, MIXED WITH STUPIDITY AND TELLING A PACK OF LIES WILL LEAD TO DISASTER. FOLLY IS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ORNAMENT OF THE STUPID. THIS MADNESS MAY AMUSE THE EMPTY-HEADED: BUT SCHEMES LIGHTLY MADE COMES TO NOTHING! A BAD TEMPER PROVOKE QUARRELS. BETTER A DISH OF VEGETABLES IF LOVE GO WITH IT THAN A FAT OX EATEN IN HATRED. THE ROAD OF THE INTELLIGENCE DILIGENT IS A HIGHWAY, A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING MAKES STRAIGHT FOR HIS GOALS. A SCOUNDREL REPEATS EVIL GOSSIP (CRYING ABOUT A WALL THAT NO ONE WANTS); IT IS LIKE A SCORCHING FIRE ON HIS LIPS. FINE TALK IS OUT OF PLACE FOR THIS BOOR, BETTER FACE A SHE-BOOR ROBBED OF HER CUBS THAN A STUPID MAN IN HIS FOLLY! WHAT USE IS MONEY IN THE HANDS OF A STUPID MAN? CAN HE BUY WISDOM IF HE HAS NO SENSE? EVEN A FOOL, IF HE HOLDS HIS PEACE IS THOUGHT WISE. PRACTICE IN EVIL MAKES PERFECT THIS SCOUNDREL. THE ONE WHO UTTERS NOTHING BUT LIES WILL NOT GO FREE. THIS FOOL TRAITOR AT THE HELM IS OUT OF PLACE. BETTER TO BE A POOR MAN THAN A LIAR. THERE IS A ROD IN PICKLE FOR THE ARROGANT, AND BLOWS READY FOR THE STUPID MAN`S BACK!!! THE MAN WHO SOWS INJUSTICE REAPS TROUBLE, THE END OF HIS WORK WILL BE THE ROD!!! THE LORD KEEPS WATCH OVER EVERY CLAIM AT LAW AND WILL OVERTURN THIS SCOUNDREL'S CASE. THERE IS A LION AND A DEEP PIT OUTSIDE. THOSE WHOM THE LORD HAS CURSED WILL FALL INTO IN. A TYRANT OPPRESS THE POOR; THE LAWLESS PRAISE THE WICKED MEN; THE LAW-ABIDING IS ABOUT TO CONTEND WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE SHOULD BE A SHAME OF HIMSELF, AND ON THE WAY TO RUSSIA! THE NEW YORK CROWBAR HOTEL IS NEXT!"	-1

Interesting and very Insightful!!.. I have a heartbreaking story to share on how I got out of Jail and became rich. Sometime June 2017, I had a business deal worth millions of dollars with some people including my best friend which lasted for 7months and it eventually pulled through. Everyone became happy and we needed to celebrate our victory, Unknowingly to me, that they were not happy because i have a higher percentage share of the money, greed had set in. They all had a plan to frame me up with a murder case so they could share the money amongst themselves. I got arrested, tried and convicted, my best friend was part of this plan. my family and business suffered a great deal while i was in jail. My family did all they could to get me out of jail to no avail. Until my wife read about a spell caster/ cure expert named Olalekan, she then contacted him and told him about me and he promised to help, eventually I got out of jail 17th November 2019. Then my wife told me about him and I contacted and told him everything that had happened and he said i shouldn't worry that i'm going to get back all I have lost, that I should file a lawsuit against them even though i do not stand a chance of winning the case. I believed in Olalekan and to my greatest surprise I won the lawsuit and got all i had lost. Also, the murder case was revisited and they were found guilty and all sentenced to jail, I'm internally grateful to Olalekan. You can reach Dr. Olalekan on whatsapp; +2349050071327 or email at: Olalekanspell@gmail.com .	-1

"The Hall of Funny Biden Faces that Make Me Forget the World is Burning

32:24 my man joe looks into the camera like jim from the office does when michael does something stupid
36:22 joe looks at trump in astonishment as he witnesses a complete 180
37:33 joe's brain fucking explodes as trump lies to his face
39:37 joe visibly thinks about saying his catchphrase ""will you shut up man,"" but refrains
40:42 😐
42:01 ""c'mon!""
44:37 the face of a man who desperately wants to throw the fuck down
49:28 joe looks to the moderator dumbfounded in such a way that can only be described as ""y'all hear sum?""
53:23 joe is again astonished as the president of the united states of america proceeds to play the blame game with him
55:14 joe makes contact with the ghost of president richard m. nixon, and they both share a look of distain as a result of trump taking his ""witch hunt"" line
57:52 the look of a man who just had his son attacked on baseless claims
1:01:18 joe is once again taken back as trump completely derails the topic and spews garbage in a quick spur of what the experts call ""baby rage""
1:03:14 ""i- this bitch""
1:13:36 joe laughs at trump's limited knowledge of how democracy works"	-1
"""It was investigated and nobody SAID that I did anything wrong in Ukraine""    Nobody said anything so therefore it didn't happen   lol .  What was that that President Trump said about healthcare in that last sentence?   They cut him off."	-1

That man is gonna make the US worse than EU. That climate lie is a business, its quite clear. First thing he talks about is economy and jobs, not the change that all that bs is gonna do for the climate. Run farmers of their land to fill fields with solar panels that only last for so long and then where u gonna dump them, wind turbines that destroy the whole ecoystem their put in and electric cars with cobalt in the batteries fueled by slave labour in the 3rd world. Biden voters are going to get the facist state they asked for. He laughed it off when Trump said the thing about wind turbines killing birds because the birds are such a small price to pay for a globalist like Biden.	-1
