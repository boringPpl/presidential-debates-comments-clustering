"When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2018 because the market outburst in December 2017 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2018 it didn't work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.
I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform.

Trump supporters don't want proof that the election was free and fair they want someone to tell them that their leader didn't actually lose to sleepy joe biden. they say biden hasn't accomplished anything in 47 years and then say he pulled off rigging an election without any court's charging him? come on you can't eat your cake and have it to. It was an election someone won someone lost we will have another election 4 years and possible it will be other way around with the other side claiming fraud like in 2016, it's a pattern people get angry when they lose both sides we saw it in 2016 and now in 2020. What we need to work on is knowing just cuz we vote doesn't mean the person we voted for is going to win, we are not entitled to win every election, America needs to learn how to lose gracefully again BOTH SIDES. There are no participation trophies in elections. period. Let's quit hurting each other and threatening each other over politicians who don't think of us other than us being a number, they don't lose sleep over us why are we fighting each other over them? if the shit hits the fan one day they are going to (all of them) are going to take care of themselves and we will be left to fend for ourselves and will need to lean on each other no matter what our political party use to be before said shit had hit the fan. spread love not hate please, we gotta do better.",-1.0

LIKE A GOLD RING IN A PIGS`S SNOUT THIS RICH MAN IS WITHOUT COMMON SENSE OR CHARACTER. A CRUEL MAN WHO MAKES TROUBLE, HAS NO RESPECT FOR HIS NEIGHBORS. WHOEVER RELIES ON HIS WEALTH AND PURSUES EVIL IS RIDING FOR A FALL. A MAN IS COMMENDED FOR HIS INTELLIGENCE, BUT A WRAPPED AND CONCEITED MIND IS DESPISED.

WAYS TRAPPED BY HIS OWN FALSEHOODS. DO HE KNOW TRUTH STANDS FIRM FOREVER, BUT LIES LIVE ONLY FOR A MOMENT. A CLEVER MAN CONCEALS HIS KNOWLEDGE, BUT A FOOLISH AND STUPID MAN BROADCAST AND PARADES HIS FOLLY. VIOLENCE IS MEAT AND DRINK FOR THE TREACHEROUS. A BRAINLESS FOOL CAUSES STRIFE BY HIS PRESUMPTIONS.

A SCOUNDREL REPEATS EVIL GOSSIP (CRYING ABOUT A WALL THAT NO ONE WANTS); IT IS LIKE A SCORCHING FIRE ON HIS LIPS. FINE TALK IS OUT OF PLACE FOR THIS BOOR, BETTER FACE A SHE-BOOR ROBBED OF HER CUBS THAN A STUPID MAN IN HIS FOLLY! WHAT USE IS MONEY IN THE HANDS OF A STUPID MAN? CAN HE BUY WISDOM IF HE HAS NO SENSE? EVEN A FOOL, IF HE HOLDS HIS PEACE IS THOUGHT WISE. PRACTICE IN EVIL MAKES PERFECT THIS SCOUNDREL. THE ONE WHO UTTERS NOTHING BUT LIES WILL NOT GO FREE. THIS FOOL TRAITOR AT THE HELM IS OUT OF PLACE. BETTER TO BE A POOR MAN THAN A LIAR. THERE IS A ROD IN PICKLE FOR THE ARROGANT, AND BLOWS READY FOR THE STUPID MAN`S BACK!!!

There were only five American Presidents who had the courage to stand up against the Corporations who have been looting and decimating the American Nation since 1783 and they were: Andrew Jackson; Abraham Lincoln; James A. Garfield; William McKinley and John F. Kennedy. Only one American President who was Andrew Jackson actually succeeded in defeating the Second Charter Financial Institution or Bank in 1836 which by Dec. 23rd 1913 overran the US Government under the American traitor and US President Woodrow Wilson.who signed into Law the Federal Reserve Act.  Incidentally it was President Andrew Jackson who Killed the Bank.and it was President John F.

"Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said after the US election that Kiev can get serious support from Joe Biden. Kostya Bondarenko is convinced that the former Ukrainian leader does not understand the essence of the issue. According to the expert, Poroshenko hopes that Biden in the presidential chair will remember the former friendly relations and support him. But it is better for the elected head of the White house not to touch the Ukrainian topic. ""Forget about words like Ukraine, Burisma, the hunter Biden scandal, and so on,"" Bondarenko said. We are talking about the corruption scandal surrounding the Ukrainian private oil and gas company Burisma. Biden's son hunter was on the company's Board of Directors. The newly elected us President Joe Biden is a native of the Ukrainian nobility, said Valery bebik, a Professor of political science at the national University of Ukraine. ""Few people know that Joe Biden is a distant descendant of the founder of the Zaporozhye Sich Vishnevetsky-Bayda. It was his great-great-great-grandfather-a London banker-who was given the gold of polubotka for safekeeping, thanks to which the United States of America rose,"" bebik said in the Ukrainian media.

"The story of how Biden and Poroshenko for a billion dollars from Joe Biden fired the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, who began to investigate the son of Joe Biden, hunter Biden, the youngest son of us Vice President Joe Biden, became a member of the Board of Directors of Burisma in April 2014 (it also included former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, a friend of the stepson of former Secretary of state John Kerry Devon Archer, and others). As part of the investigation into possible money laundering, the British authorities froze deposits in London banks for $23 million, which allegedly belonged to the owner of Burisma Zlochevsky. In Ukraine, a new scandal, and surprisingly not coronavirus. This week, the world finally saw and heard the documentary . We found out who exactly and what Poroshenko paid a billion dollars for-this is Joe Biden and the entire Obama army.
There are prospects for increasing gas production in Ukraine — but this issue depends on the normalization of the investment climate in the country and the availability of the necessary funds, says Mikhail Krutikhin, senior analyst at Rusenergy. In his opinion, at a distance of about 10 years, Kiev can replace the volume of transit (or the volume of gas that is currently supplied to the country from European countries) with its own production. ... But after Joe Biden's frequent visits to Kiev and his statements about the corruption of the Prosecutor General, the need to rid Ukraine of dependence on Russian gas and the development of the shelf with the help of the Americans, the case was closed against Joe Biden's son hunter Biden.",-1.0
