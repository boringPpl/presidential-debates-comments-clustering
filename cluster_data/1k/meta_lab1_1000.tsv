There has been cheating and Fraud on all and both sides, the issue is all if these newer ways to vote mail in, early voting.

Ok is it just me or is the entire thing (first of all a disaster) just Trump being like “I’m better than Biden. I am better than him”   He didn’t even give any concederte answers or reasons or anything like that. All trump did was shoot down Biden. I’m not saying I fully back Biden either; he has his flaws and he wouldn’t be my first choice for an ideal man in office. I just don’t know if anyone with more knowledge or brain cells related	-1

Chris is a biased fuck. Why was he in charge of all the questions?	0
This is bullshit. Biden is obviously scripted and knew the questions ahead of time. This is another part of the Big Biden lie.	-1
"If Biden really did get 80 million votes people would have gone to his rallies wearing masks. They would have showed up regardless of Biden telling them not to. 

Biden is a fraud."	-1
Trump is like a five-year old. Biden was put on the defensive from the start because all Trump did was interrupt interrupt interrupt and he never really understood the meaning of a meaningful debate	-1
This is better than anything on Netflix.	-1
Let Tyra Banks be the debate moderator or Madea and see what happens lol	-1
It only took Trump 5 minutes before he started to interrupt for the rest of the bloody debate.	-1
I dont see how you all are saying both kept interrupting it was mostly Trump interrupting when Biden was talking...	-1
1:14:46 when you're texting someone and you both stop typing to let the other person finish	-1

I don't know why people are saying this is so hilarious even my aunt and Grandpa were saying this debate was hilarious because they voted for Trump but in all reality this was just Trump flat out completely lying about having any health care plan whatsoever I wasn't that big in the Biden but Trump just completely lies about all that stuff he has no idea what Healthcare really is and it's honestly scary how he's reacting to this and he actually believe it	-1
I ve rewatched the c span debate and Yes its there for anyone to see.So if the TV Broadcasters did not make a huge Joke here with Joe Biden than its actually accurate and it happened.For anyone to see at timestamp 57:18. Really odd. First i Thought it could be his wristwatch or so? But if you take a closer look its something else.	-1
Chris is such an a**	10
Cmon guys, you’re both in your 70s! This was a disgrace from both parties	-1

Golum biden	-1
57:18	303
Biden full of critters crawling our his sleeves cuffs. And they love us so much... Imagine they care about 100,000 lives. Critters.	-1
At 57:19 where most people thought they say Biden wearing a wire.... in looking at it again now they are saying it's a tentacle? Worm-like creature? That he's a BORG? Alien species??? Wtf. It pops out... you see another one, then they disappear but seem to go UNDER his skin.	-1
Two idiots, both unfit to lead a country.	-1
57:18 What comes out of Biden's wrist and then GOES BACK IN! A medical device of some kind, like an IV?	-1
I am from india i would say that dolaand trump is very famous in india 😂😂😂😂	-1
Trump is a complete a***ole	-1
What he imposed is to get rid of Medicare and Medicaid and social security	-1
"38:43 I don't thing people understand how unbelievably important this was. Reinforcing the fact that the media was deliberately trying to make him look bad at any cost.
China Joe laughs because he knows it's working as intended."	-1
What an anomaly 🙃😝	-1
1:12:22	303
I knew Biden would pull through & become President, i knew he had something up his sleeves like at 57.13	-1
The moderator needs a therapist after this.	-1
Trump started from debating Joe to debating the moderator. Lmao.	-1
1:07:28 is only why I am here (bc I am Muslim lmao)	-1

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mxp_wgFWQo	185
Glad this embarrassing pig is out of office. Better years lie ahead!	-1
Biden probably did get away (for now) with doing the LEAST amount of work in all his years, and that’s at best.	-1
and idiots voted for him :(	-1
What are those things around Joe's left wrist at 57:18 which disappear or slither back up his sleeve?	296
Straight hilarious at .5 speed.	-1

Creepy Joe Biden snakes on his wrists, demonic @57:18 WAKE UP!!!!!	-1
This feels like it happened 100 years ago. So much has happened between this and the inauguration	-1
Look at Biden’s left wrist at 57:17 to 24 and something black pops out & it looks like a little snake or a wire that slid back in his sleeve by it’s self very weird	-1
"Thank God, finally Donald Trump can SHUT UP now.

Is he this yappy when he trhumps?"	-1
This isn't over	-1
This country is being governed by 2 GANGS full of CRIMINALS disguised as “politicians” that we as the American people pay for!!!! Our democracy is a JOKE on the world stage. Only way to have a true real democracy is to eliminate the need for this notion of a “party” Because as long as we have a republican or Democratic Party we the American people will suffer the most due to laws not being passed because of the biased opinion said party has about the other. Wake up America! They work for us not the other way around... Eliminate these gangs!	-1
Trump has no class smh😂🤦🏻‍♀️	-1
And FYI Biden is facing impeachment for only being there for four days	-1
Keep Yapping men ! hahahaha	-1
Honestly, imagine having either a child sniffer creep or an idiot ngl, Americas fucked	-1

I love how they both clearly respect eacother. It's a beautiful thing really.	-1
Around the 38:00 minute mark, that was the BEST PART OF THIS FUNNY MAD TV/SNL type of DEBATE~!!! Biden was literally laughing inside out and felt like wtf am I here instead of Wallace/moderator lolz	-1
1:15:20  That's an INSULT TO CLOWNS!!! He's way WORSE THAN JUST A CLOWN!! He's even worse than the shit that I shit=Old Donald John Trump	-1
Who's here after Biden sworn in as president??	106

"""the 200,000 people that have died under his watch, how many of those have survived?"" 
This is who leads us now."	62
This debate probably lost him a couple of states	-1
Biden lost this debate just like he lost the election. He owes his Presidency to good old ingenuity. Genius shutting down the vote count overnight in 5 states Biden needed, but having people work tirelessly through the wee hours under the cover of darkness to flip the vote. Credit where credit is due. Finally after years and years and years of losing, Biden made it to the top. Too bad his dream finally came true though only after his criminality has been exposed for all to see and he is in cognitive decline.	-1
Hmm	-1
57:16 what the fuck is in joe's sleve	296
This is the Most entertaining and most hilarious 😆 🤣Presidential debate ever	-1

This first debate, damaged USA. And in my opinion, the responsibility ist by the moderator, who had to guide both politicians, so people understand their views. I am so sorry for this great country, what it had to go through. And I am afraid, it becomes worse	-1
Trump annihilated biden	350
Trump was right about the vaccine....	-1

2:01:29 Trump interruption and outburst
2:02:05 Wallace announces debate is done, with Trump overtalking him"	-1
Trump is a kid in a man body his Mother should have slapped him when he was born.... Oooo he was dropped that says it all.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂	-1

"When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2018 because the market outburst in December 2017 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2018 it didn't work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money.
I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform.
Here is his contact via

"Hey, don't blame Biden or Trump  if you don't like either candidate!!!  Blame yourself,,  because 
society is made up of people .... yes ..... people like you and me!   We
 as a society get JUST WHAT WE DESERVE~!~   Just look at all the 
absolute shitsky in movies, television, music and the so-called ~arts~! 
 Sexual shit is mixed into our corn flakes sister~!~  We now smoke pot 
anywhere, anytime, all the time~!~  We see naked women on the city 
streets, on the beach, on t.v., and we don't flinch!?!?!?  Now we kill 
babies like in New York, where they just recently passed an abortion 
bill allowing the abortions of ~full term~  ~9 month gestation and 
normal birth~ little baby boys and girls!!!!   Gee whizzz....... isn't 
that so very loving and humane of the democrats!?!?!?!    Think twice 
about what I said here,,, in fact,,,  think thrice~!~!~!~"	-1

Look at Trader Joe's eyes light up when they mention the stock market 1:11:20	-1
"They just said that unemployment numbers are not going to be as low as the Trader Joes expected... That's why they JUST NOW extended the unemployment terms and that just resulted in MORE CITIZENS FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT to make EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE for enabling an easier turn around for the incoming party now being called the ""Trader Joe's"" Party"	-1
"TRUMP: ""Dr. Fauci himself said masks were not good"" MORE FACTS PROVEN TODAY ! Masks are ineffective and showed the same if not more spikes in the virus since. And it has also proven to weaken our immune systems so we believe we are sick , go get tested and endure false positive or negative results"	-1
"TRUMP: ""Those states want to stay closed until after the election because it's a political thing"" ...... MORE FACTS PROVEN TODAY"	-1
Someone should teach them the rules of debate XD	-1
"BIDEN CAMPAIGN : When you start losing the debate just bring up the Covid numbers and the people will follow
JOE BIDEN: Oh oh oh okkkay"	-1
Biden said Trump knew about the virus back in February however he was called racist for trying to shut down China in January... Biden's hypocrisy has all unfolded and the coup has come to light. From the spying , to the Russian hoax, to covid...  Going all the way back to the Obama Administration.. They committed treason and conspired with China to get Trump out of office since we owed them 2 Trillion dollars.. which ironically is equivalent to Biden's Covid Relief Plan... You're Welcome people.	-1
Honest question. People who voted for Biden. Without mentioning your hatred for Trump tell me why you like Biden and what he is about. I am trying to have an open mind. Again, please don't bring Trump into the conversation.	-1
You need a higher IQ to comprehend what Trump is saying . Most don’t have that .	-1
