Look at Biden face when he says that ANTIFA is just an idea. I believe he believe that. They have him under the impression. Least I think. He’s just a puppet for them. We have to stop this man. You Google Antifa and it goes straight to the White House.   No bullshit. Do it try and see for yourself.  We are all screwed now.  Got to stop this all. Keep the walls and what’s funny is Biden said he wouldn’t let another inch of the wall up. BUT HES NOW LIVING IN A PLACE THATS FENCED IN. BARB WIRES. WTF?  Someone adopt me from Italy please!!!	304
Impeach Biden. He’s destroying America. The cartel are here. Children being sent to the Dallas Convention Center  No vaccines for them yet that I’ve heard. Children are taking turns sleeping on the floor. What’s going on with the Dem Party? Wake the heck up now!!!!!!	-1
There has been cheating and Fraud on all and both sides, the issue is all if these newer ways to vote mail in, early voting. Absentee, Social Election, Overseas, Drop Off, so much easier for cheating to occur and a lot harder to distinguish cheating going on as well. It's inly going to get worse in 2024.	-1

@ 1:32:59 you see  Wallace set Trump up. He ask Trump to tell them to stand down. And you can see both the moderator and Wallace egg him on. They are saying do it! And when he says stand back and stand by meaning to not add to the violence, you see Joe with a wide smile! They got there clip they wanted! This is sick folks! Real dirty!	-1
It way too obvious I’m reading!	-1
President Trump was all by himself in this debate. With the exception of wrestling with Chris here and there	-1

This debate was fitting, in the worst year of most of our lives.  One is a semi-celebrity who won because Mrs. Clinton was so disliked.  The other is a rambling career politician.  I don't care for either candidate, but at least Biden will bring respectability back to the country.	-1

Ok is it just me or is the entire thing (first of all a disaster) just Trump being like “I’m better than Biden. I am better than him”   He didn’t even give any concederte answers or reasons or anything like that. All trump did was shoot down Biden. I’m not saying I fully back Biden either; he has his flaws and he wouldn’t be my first choice for an ideal man in office. I just don’t know if anyone with more knowledge or brain cells related	-1

拜登小儿闭嘴，川大统领说你不聪明就是不聪明!	8
Chris is a biased fuck. Why was he in charge of all the questions?	0
This is bullshit. Biden is obviously scripted and knew the questions ahead of time. This is another part of the Big Biden lie.	-1
If Biden really did get 80 million votes people would have gone to his rallies wearing masks. They would have showed up regardless of Biden telling them not to.   Biden is a fraud.	-1
Trump is like a five-year old. Biden was put on the defensive from the start because all Trump did was interrupt interrupt interrupt and he never really understood the meaning of a meaningful debate	-1
This is better than anything on Netflix.	-1
Let Tyra Banks be the debate moderator or Madea and see what happens lol	-1
It only took Trump 5 minutes before he started to interrupt for the rest of the bloody debate.	-1
I dont see how you all are saying both kept interrupting it was mostly Trump interrupting when Biden was talking...	-1
1:14:46 when you're texting someone and you both stop typing to let the other person finish	-1
Chris Wallace is sadly the WORST moderator EVER. He was PROTECTING Biden to make him look “GOOD”. TRUMP WAS ACTUALLY ROASTING THE HELL OUT OF BIDEN!	316
IM SORRY BUT I CAN'T TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY 😂	-1
Best part of the debate 44:47	14

If Trump and Biden were Xbox Live players	-1
I don't know why people are saying this is so hilarious even my aunt and Grandpa were saying this debate was hilarious because they voted for Trump but in all reality this was just Trump flat out completely lying about having any health care plan whatsoever I wasn't that big in the Biden but Trump just completely lies about all that stuff he has no idea what Healthcare really is and it's honestly scary how he's reacting to this and he actually believe it	-1
I ve rewatched the c span debate and Yes its there for anyone to see.So if the TV Broadcasters did not make a huge Joke here with Joe Biden than its actually accurate and it happened.For anyone to see at timestamp 57:18. Really odd. First i Thought it could be his wristwatch or so? But if you take a closer look its something else.	-1
Chris is such an a**	5
Cmon guys, you’re both in your 70s! This was a disgrace from both parties	-1
Who else is watching after inauguration day	-1

Biden: *nOt TrUe!!!*	-1
Trump acts like a victim all the time. Bring out the violins.	-1

Golum biden	-1
57:18	302
Biden full of critters crawling our his sleeves cuffs. And they love us so much... Imagine they care about 100,000 lives. Critters.	-1
At 57:19 where most people thought they say Biden wearing a wire.... in looking at it again now they are saying it's a tentacle? Worm-like creature? That he's a BORG? Alien species??? Wtf. It pops out... you see another one, then they disappear but seem to go UNDER his skin.	-1
Two idiots, both unfit to lead a country.	-1
57:18 What comes out of Biden's wrist and then GOES BACK IN! A medical device of some kind, like an IV?	-1
I am from india i would say that dolaand trump is very famous in india 😂😂😂😂	-1
Trump is a complete a***ole	-1
What he imposed is to get rid of Medicare and Medicaid and social security	-1
38:43 I don't thing people understand how unbelievably important this was. Reinforcing the fact that the media was deliberately trying to make him look bad at any cost. China Joe laughs because he knows it's working as intended.	-1
What an anomaly 🙃😝	-1
1:12:22	302
I knew Biden would pull through & become President, i knew he had something up his sleeves like at 57.13	-1
The moderator needs a therapist after this.	-1
Trump started from debating Joe to debating the moderator. Lmao.	96
1:07:28 is only why I am here (bc I am Muslim lmao)	-1
Biden: maybe we should drop nuclear weapon Trump : i haven’t say that Me: TRUMP IS A BIG LiAR!	-1
12:27 🤦🏻‍♂️ This guys skipped #2	-1
At 57:15 look at Biden’s left hand, at the bottom right of the screen. You might have to put it to x5	-1
No one else here about the sleeve creature?	-1

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mxp_wgFWQo	167
Glad this embarrassing pig is out of office. Better years lie ahead!	-1
Biden probably did get away (for now) with doing the LEAST amount of work in all his years, and that’s at best.	-1
and idiots voted for him :(	-1
What are those things around Joe's left wrist at 57:18 which disappear or slither back up his sleeve?	-1
Straight hilarious at .5 speed.	-1
Like I’f you’re watching this in 2021	-1
*thankful Biden won the election*	-1
Douche or the Turd?  Voting rules!!!	-1
We can’t make America great again😖	-1
How can you say trump is a liar when you didn’t do shit for 47 years	-1
Creepy Joe Biden snakes on his wrists, demonic @57:18 WAKE UP!!!!!	-1
This feels like it happened 100 years ago. So much has happened between this and the inauguration	-1
Look at Biden’s left wrist at 57:17 to 24 and something black pops out & it looks like a little snake or a wire that slid back in his sleeve by it’s self very weird	-1
Thank God, finally Donald Trump can SHUT UP now.  Is he this yappy when he trhumps?	-1
This isn't over	-1
This country is being governed by 2 GANGS full of CRIMINALS disguised as “politicians” that we as the American people pay for!!!! Our democracy is a JOKE on the world stage. Only way to have a true real democracy is to eliminate the need for this notion of a “party” Because as long as we have a republican or Democratic Party we the American people will suffer the most due to laws not being passed because of the biased opinion said party has about the other. Wake up America! They work for us not the other way around... Eliminate these gangs!	-1
Trump has no class smh😂🤦🏻‍♀️	-1
And FYI Biden is facing impeachment for only being there for four days	-1
Keep Yapping men ! hahahaha	-1
Honestly, imagine having either a child sniffer creep or an idiot ngl, Americas fucked	-1

Around the 38:00 minute mark, that was the BEST PART OF THIS FUNNY MAD TV/SNL type of DEBATE~!!! Biden was literally laughing inside out and felt like wtf am I here instead of Wallace/moderator lolz	-1
1:15:20  That's an INSULT TO CLOWNS!!! He's way WORSE THAN JUST A CLOWN!! He's even worse than the shit that I shit=Old Donald John Trump	-1

50:31 3 and a half months later, he was right	-1
I just come back here to get a good laugh.	-1
"""the 200,000 people that have died under his watch, how many of those have survived?""  This is who leads us now."	62
This debate probably lost him a couple of states	-1
Biden lost this debate just like he lost the election. He owes his Presidency to good old ingenuity. Genius shutting down the vote count overnight in 5 states Biden needed, but having people work tirelessly through the wee hours under the cover of darkness to flip the vote. Credit where credit is due. Finally after years and years and years of losing, Biden made it to the top. Too bad his dream finally came true though only after his criminality has been exposed for all to see and he is in cognitive decline.	-1
Hmm	-1
57:16 what the fuck is in joe's sleve	221
This is the Most entertaining and most hilarious 😆 🤣Presidential debate ever	-1
Wow. Biden really said it. “Shut up”. That’s a first and it’s great XD	-1

We miss you Trump!	-1
Holy shit 1:34:14. He's so right.	-1
Whos here after the innaugration?	-1
This first debate, damaged USA. And in my opinion, the responsibility ist by the moderator, who had to guide both politicians, so people understand their views. I am so sorry for this great country, what it had to go through. And I am afraid, it becomes worse	-1
Trump annihilated biden	354
Trump was right about the vaccine....	-1

Nancy could have been a much better moderator.  Maybe even Kamala	-1
When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2018 because the market outburst in December 2017 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2018 it didn't work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money. I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform. Here is his contact via  Email Address:Ronsonbaylor @gmail .com Tele gram: @Expert_Baylorfx WhatsApp: ☎️+ 1 5 0 9 3 4 2 7 0 7 7.	-1

Look at Trader Joe's eyes light up when they mention the stock market 1:11:20	-1
"They just said that unemployment numbers are not going to be as low as the Trader Joes expected... That's why they JUST NOW extended the unemployment terms and that just resulted in MORE CITIZENS FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT to make EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE for enabling an easier turn around for the incoming party now being called the ""Trader Joe's"" Party"	-1
"TRUMP: ""Dr. Fauci himself said masks were not good"" MORE FACTS PROVEN TODAY ! Masks are ineffective and showed the same if not more spikes in the virus since. And it has also proven to weaken our immune systems so we believe we are sick , go get tested and endure false positive or negative results"	-1
"TRUMP: ""Those states want to stay closed until after the election because it's a political thing"" ...... MORE FACTS PROVEN TODAY"	-1
Someone should teach them the rules of debate XD	-1
BIDEN CAMPAIGN : When you start losing the debate just bring up the Covid numbers and the people will follow JOE BIDEN: Oh oh oh okkkay	-1
Biden said Trump knew about the virus back in February however he was called racist for trying to shut down China in January... Biden's hypocrisy has all unfolded and the coup has come to light. From the spying , to the Russian hoax, to covid...  Going all the way back to the Obama Administration.. They committed treason and conspired with China to get Trump out of office since we owed them 2 Trillion dollars.. which ironically is equivalent to Biden's Covid Relief Plan... You're Welcome people.	-1
Honest question. People who voted for Biden. Without mentioning your hatred for Trump tell me why you like Biden and what he is about. I am trying to have an open mind. Again, please don't bring Trump into the conversation.	-1

Trump should have create his own comedy show as a comedian and a TV host. But instead of that, he ran for president to commit the abuse of power, blame others who are probably not responsible for major problems, and make jokes on his staff and his followers.	-1

It's a shame so many people are distracted by the constant bickering and interruptions. I don't blame them, but this was an extremely important debate that showed much more than how much Trump was interrupting.	-1
1:14:44 WTF?	-1
Law enforcement get a bad rep only because of their fears. Train them on negotiation skills. Use force as the last resort instead of attack.  Thumps up for this please. b/c tomany lives lost and it's unnecessary.  There must be a space to really fuck up once and NOT end up dead.  We should be  counting on  law enforcement to  protect us all not kill us. We must feel safe with the law enforcement. No tickets over small things.    did you know they have a quota to meet? find some one to make money off of... Whaaaa? It's should nt be a business.  thats all Im gonna say about this. I love cops but they go to stupid school for training.  If we don't act up there would be only real crime to actually solve... well o.k now Im stopping.. lol	-1

"This shit: is why the rest of the world is laughing at you. Your greedy, arrogant, patriotistic racism towards the world is shameful enough. But when you believe the words of the world government's bitches who are just on the stage quoting stone age history, thats when the rest of us understand why you guys are the dumbest. Why dont you try learn a few things from the East maybe it will make the obese nation built on genocide and rape ""great"" again. We are all slaves but if we side with the elite's attempt to use our obsession with patriotism then what? Then you have failed as a human being. A hungry family is a hungry family. Put the guns down and use your brains for once. Wake up and demand change you trigger happy money freaks. We cannot evolve if we dont aim to acknowledge that WE ARE ONE RACE. And creating a virus to send into China clearly wont work either"	-1

Trump got 410 electoral votes and 107,000,000 popular votes but Mark Zuckerberg spent $400,000,000 and had voter machines switch 6,000,000 from Trump to Biden illegally.	-1
I have been doing some investigating and it I am regretful about informing you that it seems as though... Unfortunately... This claim is incorrect. The blackened eyeballs were a result of low resolution and trying to record a digital screen with a digital camera... if you watch this debate in 1080p then you can clearly see his eyes. That doesn't mean he is not a Lizard person, though.	-1
Fucking comedy. 2 immature clowns who can't even take turns talking like adults are our choices for a leader smh we r fucked	-1
"The grandiosity of Wallace is ten times worse than Trump's interrupting. ""...[U]ntil the election is independently certified."" By whom, Wallace? You? Where is the ""independently certified"" clause in the Constitution? Is it in Article II or in the 12th Amendment, you douchebag? The presidential election is certified by the Congress on January 6th, you insufferably supercilious ponce."	-1

Just like Hillary in 2016 calling foul donald trump was never going to agree with losing not in 2016 not in 2020, you could have every investigative official in the world investigate his claims and until one of them says what he and his followers want to hear they will just say those investigators are in on the steal, they don't want proof that it was fair and free they want someone to agree with them so they don't have to eat crow and admit that their supreme leader actually lost against someone they called the worst candidate in history, i don't even like politics and don't care for either of these guys but this is common sense. Trump supporters don't want proof that the election was free and fair they want someone to tell them that their leader didn't actually lose to sleepy joe biden. they say biden hasn't accomplished anything in 47 years and then say he pulled off rigging an election without any court's charging him? come on you can't eat your cake and have it to. It was an election someone won someone lost we will have another election 4 years and possible it will be other way around with the other side claiming fraud like in 2016, it's a pattern people get angry when they lose both sides we saw it in 2016 and now in 2020. What we need to work on is knowing just cuz we vote doesn't mean the person we voted for is going to win, we are not entitled to win every election, America needs to learn how to lose gracefully again BOTH SIDES. There are no participation trophies in elections. period. Let's quit hurting each other and threatening each other over politicians who don't think of us other than us being a number, they don't lose sleep over us why are we fighting each other over them? if the shit hits the fan one day they are going to (all of them) are going to take care of themselves and we will be left to fend for ourselves and will need to lean on each other no matter what our political party use to be before said shit had hit the fan. spread love not hate please, we gotta do better.	-1

Really Biden? You left Trump with a booming economy? That's fucking hilarious. Finding a job during Obama's fucked up administration was near impossible, even with a degree. All that asshole wanted to do was keep pushing his precious Obama Care, and we still had thousands of out-sourced jobs. The scary thing is, it's going to happen again. Yeah Biden, no shit we're about to walk into a dark winter, because your Dracula ass. 1:53:45 - He was right. He saw it coming from a mile away, and there you have it.	-1

I don’t know why the media bash Chris so much about this debate. Truthfully he handled it the best way he could considering he is dealing with a child. Thankfully they had a mute button the second time around which helped the moderator, but this would have been a hard job for anyone.	-1
Joe won decisively.  Now let's undo *every last thing* Trump did.  Trump, the WORST President in U.S. history.	-1
"mr Trump...despite your lies, insults, digs, and interruptions....I have a ""SAD"" news flash for you....YOU LOSE....you are FIRED...you are FINISHED!!!"	-1
Chris is absolutely the worst. Total ass	5
1:52:53  if we get the votes, it's gonna be all over, he can't stay in power, it won't happen, it won't happen....PROPHETIC WORDS...	-1
Trump’s foundation shade is a bit off. Not sure if they didnt blend it properly.	-1
OMG open up the fucking federal building so I can LEAVE NOW BASTARDS	-1
Mr.Pres. Trump you really did a good job debating the best debates ever i have had heard you nailed it i like your energy everything is out there.one thing more there's no war in your time.. Republicans did a good job..	-1
they should've put donald trump on the right instead of the left he's a republican not a democrat	-1
Go ASK THE HOUSE CABINET MY UNCLE BUTCH IN TEAG TEXAS	-1
Man Biden is truly a spoiled brat	-1
they needed Judge Judy and Gordon Ramsay as the moderator	-1
Joe did it💪🏻	-1
42:42 Trump did try to take away pre-existing condition coverage by block granting the money for Obamacare and letting the states do it.	-1
@32:53 I disagree, a presidents term is 4 years and he/she gets to nominate who they want as a SC Justice and the Senate gets to confirm or not confirm them.	-1
Moderator is a piece of human filth	132
who really watched from the beginning all the way to the end? I did	-1
Why didn't they shake their hands when they've entered?	-1
I'm sorry but Trump continuing to call Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas is hilarious !!	-1

Anarchism is the solution to the world's problems.  RESEARCH ANARCHISM VIVA REVOLUTION!	-1
1:39:02 you could hear the anger in Biden’s voice when he called out trump on calling people who are in the military “suckers and losers”	-1
It was a normal debate until 35:27😂	-1
As an Australian, America does not seem ok.	-1

President punk ass trump u were very unprofessional !!!!  And that is why u lost the election !! Goofy😂	-1
When I’m scrolling down the comments section, I literally keep seeing a user named K Dixon (total trump supporter and it shows) completely bash on Biden and his win in the same day or week since all her comments are 3 weeks ago. Just shows how petty and immature the trumpers can really be.	-1
Trump is  a goofy .... Smh	-1

God I was so irritated nervous and sweaty ( cant stress just how sweaty I was ) watching this live. Now that democracy has prevailed its funny as hell.	-1
Biden: makes a point Trump: Bernie	-1
Biden body language speaks louder than his words. What a bum. Denies his son gets paid and now he is under investigation.  What a joke	-1
Good luck USA.....you are officially under communism rule. Have fun	-1
40:26 “Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the Manifesto we call it”	-1
Trump is truly psychotic. A madman. Any psychiatrist would have Trump committed immediately.	-1
Oh dear the comments are open. Viewer discretion advised...	-1
Leaving the comments open. Bold decision CSPAN	-1
Trump believed he would win beyond a shadow of a doubt, I can see why he is so upset with the result, his ego literally won't let him accept that Joe won, I think it's brilliant.	-1
I feel jipped, I only got one ballot. ;)	-1
“To argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason, and whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like administering medicine to the dead, or endeavoring to convert an atheist by scripture.” ― Thomas Paine (1737 - 1809), The American Crisis	-1
200,000 Americans die... Trump: It is what it is Biden: It is what it is cuz you are who you are.  Obama: *drains 3-pointer* “that’s what we do!” *walks away with Biden*	-1

mass distributing critical documents is surely treasonous	-1
Can we appreciate that Trump called all this garbage that is occurring now, ahead of time. Try telling me that he hasn't made a plan to overcome this.	-1
Trump's comments about election integrity aged like fine wine. If you support Beijing Biden you have some learning to do. Its easier for Biden to fool you than it is for anyone to convince you that you have been fooled.	-1
The only transitioning for Biden should be into a cell in Gitmo.	-1
trump really called the election fraud.  wow	-1
It's the Trump -Wallace debate.	-1
Sounds like Trump knew about the 2020 election fraud in advance. Now youtube is deleting videos that cover the widespread fraud	-1
When I get bored I watch both elections for a good laugh.	-1
1:51:00 aged like fine wine	-1
Chris Wallace says hundreds of thousands of ballots are typically thrown out and, yet hardly any ballots were thrown out. Hmmm.	-1
Obama was a super predator then.	-1
Biden got ripped to shreds. He needs to spend his final years with his grandchildren. What a joke. Goodbye America. Nice knowin' ya.	-1
Thanks.. Appreciated 💯🌅	-1

44:41 It is mental LMFAO  . Wow a new  height of the greatest nation in the world	-1
I wanted Lawrence O'Donnell as the moderator.	-1
I think if they announced they had a vaccine before the election trump might have won.	-1
i  dont   have   anything    to   say   about   Chris Wallace	177
1:52:50  is my favorite part!	-1
Fun fact: Biden is NOT the president and this election is still under investigation. Trump 2020 💪🏿💪🏿	-1
trump is saving the country and biden is like uh... you uh... shut up man uh... you know the thing.	-1

I can not believe people like this are in power somewhere, this is ridiculous. Trump treats Biden like an apprentice he is about to fire. I worry about the future and what America is going to turn out like, don't get the rest of us killed 'Meerriiicaa!	-1

How was Biden so Calm Throughout This? He didn't even shout at the guy for *2 hours*	-1
This is hilarious lol I'm gonna miss trump lol	-1
The clear billboard univariably rot because flower ostensibly watch underneath a  woman. tasteful, brash brandy	-1
Kamala is breaking barriers. NEVER EVER insult a woman especially someone who is in power or has experienced racial profiling. The reason she is like that is because she cares about taking care of the pandemic	-1
I could had swore that at some point, during this debate of the second debate, that Biden was asked if he would take the vaccine, and Biden said NO. Anyone else remember this?    I listened to time stamp 53-60 to see if I could find it, but I can’t.	-1
Judge Judy should've moderated this.	-1
DUDE!!!! SHUT THE HELL UP!	158

wow Donald you big kid 50:45 Biden makes a point on how many people had to wake up to a empty chair because of covid-19 maybe they should send him here to England to our government about stopping opening and closing schools pubs and other places that involves socializing it's clear that they really don't know what they are doing how they got the job it's beyond me its not going to end in 2021 the world is 100% nigh launch the nukes	-1

AMERICA SENT A FOOL ON AN ERRAND AND HE HAS CUT HER LEGS OFF AND DISPLAYED THE STOMPS  SOON YOUR TONGUE WILL BE BRIDLED. YOU THINK, NOW I TALK. A SCOUNDREL, NUMBNUTS IS A LYING, FOOLISH, AND A FLIGHTY CREATURE. A SIMPLETON WHO CARES FOR NOTHING AND NO ONE BUT HIMSELF. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TREATING US AS CATTLE? ARE WE NOTHING BUT BRUTE BEAST TO YOU? IS THE EARTH A DESERT TO PROVE YOU RIGHT? WHEN A FOOL SPEAKS RUIN IS NEAR. LEWDNESS AND TARDINESS IS SPORT FOR THE STUPID. A GODLESS MAN WHO NEVER LISTENS TO CORRECTION. HATE IS ALWAYS PICKING A QUARREL. BY HIS WORDS THIS GODLESS MAN HAS RUINED MANY OTHERS. LIKE A GOLD RING IN A PIGS`S SNOUT THIS RICH MAN IS WITHOUT COMMON SENSE OR CHARACTER. A CRUEL MAN WHO MAKES TROUBLE, HAS NO RESPECT FOR HIS NEIGHBORS. WHOEVER RELIES ON HIS WEALTH AND PURSUES EVIL IS RIDING FOR A FALL. A MAN IS COMMENDED FOR HIS INTELLIGENCE, BUT A WRAPPED AND CONCEITED MIND IS DESPISED. THIS FOOL THINKS HE IS ALWAYS RIGHT: THEREFORE IS A WAYS TRAPPED BY HIS OWN FALSEHOODS. DO HE KNOW TRUTH STANDS FIRM FOREVER, BUT LIES LIVE ONLY FOR A MOMENT. A CLEVER MAN CONCEALS HIS KNOWLEDGE, BUT A FOOLISH AND STUPID MAN BROADCAST AND PARADES HIS FOLLY. VIOLENCE IS MEAT AND DRINK FOR THE TREACHEROUS. A BRAINLESS FOOL CAUSES STRIFE BY HIS PRESUMPTIONS. ILL FORTUNE FOLLOWS A SINNER CLOSE BEHIND, MIXED WITH STUPIDITY AND TELLING A PACK OF LIES WILL LEAD TO DISASTER. FOLLY IS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ORNAMENT OF THE STUPID. THIS MADNESS MAY AMUSE THE EMPTY-HEADED: BUT SCHEMES LIGHTLY MADE COMES TO NOTHING! A BAD TEMPER PROVOKE QUARRELS. BETTER A DISH OF VEGETABLES IF LOVE GO WITH IT THAN A FAT OX EATEN IN HATRED. THE ROAD OF THE INTELLIGENCE DILIGENT IS A HIGHWAY, A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING MAKES STRAIGHT FOR HIS GOALS. A SCOUNDREL REPEATS EVIL GOSSIP (CRYING ABOUT A WALL THAT NO ONE WANTS); IT IS LIKE A SCORCHING FIRE ON HIS LIPS. FINE TALK IS OUT OF PLACE FOR THIS BOOR, BETTER FACE A SHE-BOOR ROBBED OF HER CUBS THAN A STUPID MAN IN HIS FOLLY! WHAT USE IS MONEY IN THE HANDS OF A STUPID MAN? CAN HE BUY WISDOM IF HE HAS NO SENSE? EVEN A FOOL, IF HE HOLDS HIS PEACE IS THOUGHT WISE. PRACTICE IN EVIL MAKES PERFECT THIS SCOUNDREL. THE ONE WHO UTTERS NOTHING BUT LIES WILL NOT GO FREE. THIS FOOL TRAITOR AT THE HELM IS OUT OF PLACE. BETTER TO BE A POOR MAN THAN A LIAR. THERE IS A ROD IN PICKLE FOR THE ARROGANT, AND BLOWS READY FOR THE STUPID MAN`S BACK!!! THE MAN WHO SOWS INJUSTICE REAPS TROUBLE, THE END OF HIS WORK WILL BE THE ROD!!! THE LORD KEEPS WATCH OVER EVERY CLAIM AT LAW AND WILL OVERTURN THIS SCOUNDREL'S CASE. THERE IS A LION AND A DEEP PIT OUTSIDE. THOSE WHOM THE LORD HAS CURSED WILL FALL INTO IN. A TYRANT OPPRESS THE POOR; THE LAWLESS PRAISE THE WICKED MEN; THE LAW-ABIDING IS ABOUT TO CONTEND WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE SHOULD BE A SHAME OF HIMSELF, AND ON THE WAY TO RUSSIA! THE NEW YORK CROWBAR HOTEL IS NEXT!	-1

Personally, I think Trump constantly interrupting was just one of many reasons why he lost the election.	-1
i knew this wasnt going to be a good debate when they didnt shake hands in the beginning	-1
I'm gonna come back to this often for chuckles in the years to come 😄	-1
TRUMP2020	268
Proud boys ya better stand by!  Why? What's gonna happen?	-1
"""Will you shut up man"" Lmao gangsta"	-1
How the hell did this orange clown become president.... he is not even a good businessman, having an extremely wealthy father who hands you cash is not a businessman.	-1
Trump: Let me tell you something.. Joe: Will you please just shut up man..	138
"""HERE'S THE DEAL!"""	18
:)	9
44:10 So the big “will you shut up man?” Media headline alluding to Biden being interrupted was actually a derailment of Trumps disbelief that Biden refused to answer a very important question... wow	-1
"Im using my moms acc thats why the names weird but at the start when they walk in u can see biden saying to trump: ""how ya doin man"" but idk bout trump lol"	-1
trump honey...this didn’t age well~	-1
Biden looks like a postponed corpse...	-1
The funny thing is how I came here to laugh instead to hear the actual debate	-1
Imagine if those people would run for president. We would be doomed.	-1
I fuck with  trump if you didn’t vote for him and you get Pua unemployment you should check your account 😂 your shit is being taken real soon. !!!who did it ? Biden did it watch and see this shit unfold	-1
It would be true that there are not any emmisions while driving an electic car, but the poruduction pollutes the enviroment much more and its not easy to recycle the batteries.	-1
so, uh, the moderator-it isn't his first job  in his life, no?	-1
face of matter is Biden could have been stun if Trump would have reveal a new plan for future and expose it biden would have had nothing as for the virus  the lie  that continues  the truth should have been publish as it is NOW  ON WHO web site . Trump did everything he could to provide answer for virus  , he was correct in doing nothing simple as that let it be and continue to fine a cure  and attack china ,	-1
Trump has denounced White Supremacists - He speaks out against Antifa and extreme left all the time. It's a rhetorical question too. You would be a fool to answer it. Any reasonable person denounces any sort of supremacy.	155
Eh they stood up the whole debate 😢😢😢	-1
Bruh focus on the video. Don't read the comments.	-1
2 mins uninterrupted. Both: uninterrupted is a mere suggestion.	-1
Americans: Oh shit America is going to suffer in the coming years.. Non-Americans: yay free comedy show 🤓🤓🤓	-1
I'm so glad Biden won!	-1
They’re not really debating each other they’re more like roasting each other	-1
I just witnessed the will you shut up man meme I feel complete	-1

what in the hell is this bafoon laughing about....nothing funny about this criminal shit going on in our White House....it is nothing but a nervous laugh coming from biden....sickening pitiful debate....our president should have been spared the political hassel from this joker......	-1
Why is the orange one always butting in?	-1
who came here for the memes? lmao 😂	-1
I don't think I've ever found Biden more relatable than when he told Trump to shut up and called him a clown. Based Biden!	-1
Shoulda been Yang up there 🤦‍♂️	-1
Biden: trump = idiotic clown and an embarrassment to america  Trump: biden = fun to interrupt and piss off	-1

Happy Thanksgiving 2020. 55 days until Donald Trump leaves the White House forever and takes all his scumbags with him. The nightmare is almost over, I feel like 10,000 pounds has been lifted off my shoulders, it's going to be so wonderful to have a real president again.	-1

For years Biden did nothing. The guy calls Trump a racist. Biden explained during the 1994 crime bill that he didn’t want his children growing up in a racial jungle. He said that he said a lot more but I don’t want to get graphic online. Anyways, my point is Joe Biden is just as racist or even more racist than Donald Trump.	-1
The woman for the second debate was the better moderator lol.	-1

There were only five American Presidents who had the courage to stand up against the Corporations who have been looting and decimating the American Nation since 1783 and they were: Andrew Jackson; Abraham Lincoln; James A. Garfield; William McKinley and John F. Kennedy. Only one American President who was Andrew Jackson actually succeeded in defeating the Second Charter Financial Institution or Bank in 1836 which by Dec. 23rd 1913 overran the US Government under the American traitor and US President Woodrow Wilson.who signed into Law the Federal Reserve Act.  Incidentally it was President Andrew Jackson who Killed the Bank.and it was President John F. Kennedy who attempted to Federalize the Federal Reserve Bank which is not Federal and has no Reserve.	-1
Makes no difference which one you choose, either way we're all getting screwed.	-1

"Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said after the US election that Kiev can get serious support from Joe Biden. Kostya Bondarenko is convinced that the former Ukrainian leader does not understand the essence of the issue. According to the expert, Poroshenko hopes that Biden in the presidential chair will remember the former friendly relations and support him. But it is better for the elected head of the White house not to touch the Ukrainian topic. ""Forget about words like Ukraine, Burisma, the hunter Biden scandal, and so on,"" Bondarenko said. We are talking about the corruption scandal surrounding the Ukrainian private oil and gas company Burisma. Biden's son hunter was on the company's Board of Directors. The newly elected us President Joe Biden is a native of the Ukrainian nobility, said Valery bebik, a Professor of political science at the national University of Ukraine. ""Few people know that Joe Biden is a distant descendant of the founder of the Zaporozhye Sich Vishnevetsky-Bayda. It was his great-great-great-grandfather-a London banker-who was given the gold of polubotka for safekeeping, thanks to which the United States of America rose,"" bebik said in the Ukrainian media. ""Gold polubotka"" - a popular pseudo-historical myth in Ukraine about how the ""Jewish plutocracy"" in the XVIII robbed Ukrainians."	-1
44:47, wow, lol	300
There is racial insensitivity but with the majority it is not.	-1
I assure trump that we will support our law enforcement.  Certain things we will not!	-1
Yes, trump did the math and chose to divide.  Now, we have many, many cult members.  Can those be saved?	-1
Oh yah sure!  Your statement was inappropriate with hate behind it.	-1
Now he is blaming Biden for his current predicament?	-1
He paid millions in taxes?  He just didn’t say when and what happened after that.	-1
Teachers are working hard and getting burnt out!	-1
The economy is recovering but not like it did with Obama.   The effects of this are still to come and it started under trumps  adm.   Look at those that can’t pay their mortgage/rent and look at the food lines today.	-1
Except his rallies.  Hardly anyone wore a mask.  Look at S.D.  That governor still doesn’t understand reality.	-1
In defense I’d trump, he didn’t sit on his golf course.  He played golf!	-1

Watching this a second time, look at the scorn on dump trumps face and the smile on Biden.  Who held up Obama’s pick for the Supreme Court.  First lie out of trumps mouth.	-1
To everyone who voted, thank you.  This was a record turnout.  Thank goodness the election is over.  Can we try to unite and show that America is better and stronger than ever?	-1
I didn't vote this year because i was afraid Trump would win but i'm glad Biden won.	-1
47:24	302
Don’t any offense people but Biden literally said nothing much, the whole time he was just talking badly about Trump and mocking his plans, and repeating the same things he had said previously. I’m not saying I support Trump, but I’d say Trump would still be a better President than Biden. And I know people will tell me otherwise but answer me this, are you really a Biden supporter or just an anti-Trump person?	-1

The story of how Biden and Poroshenko for a billion dollars from Joe Biden fired the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, who began to investigate the son of Joe Biden, hunter Biden, the youngest son of us Vice President Joe Biden, became a member of the Board of Directors of Burisma in April 2014 (it also included former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, a friend of the stepson of former Secretary of state John Kerry Devon Archer, and others). As part of the investigation into possible money laundering, the British authorities froze deposits in London banks for $23 million, which allegedly belonged to the owner of Burisma Zlochevsky. In Ukraine, a new scandal, and surprisingly not coronavirus. This week, the world finally saw and heard the documentary . We found out who exactly and what Poroshenko paid a billion dollars for-this is Joe Biden and the entire Obama army. There are prospects for increasing gas production in Ukraine — but this issue depends on the normalization of the investment climate in the country and the availability of the necessary funds, says Mikhail Krutikhin, senior analyst at Rusenergy. In his opinion, at a distance of about 10 years, Kiev can replace the volume of transit (or the volume of gas that is currently supplied to the country from European countries) with its own production. ... But after Joe Biden's frequent visits to Kiev and his statements about the corruption of the Prosecutor General, the need to rid Ukraine of dependence on Russian gas and the development of the shelf with the help of the Americans, the case was closed against Joe Biden's son hunter Biden.	-1

CNN USING BIG SUBTITLES TO DISTRACT!!!       BIDEN WEARING A WIRE....  (10:31 regular timeline    For CNN video Scroll to 1:02:18     WATCH BIDEN's Hand --  script...Trump : A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do.  ( RIGHT HERE LOOK AT BIDEN'S HAND ) They can social distance.     (RIGHT HERE) They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.  President Donald J. Trump: (11:04)  When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you         https://twitter.com/Media__Ferret/status/1311167917636059144?s=20&fbclid=IwAR2JDzFKMou_evP2GTfYfAdxZaM7TBdpMZRHvYfhtWhdtabUeQU3YExgM3Y  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7YycpxoKSw	-1
Just let these two get married and Trump is staying in the White House, how’s that sound?	-1
For historical context, let it be remembered that nearly the entire republican side of the audience (including trump family members) were recklessly and unbeknownst at the time shedding/spewing CORONAVIRUS all throughout auditorium... they refused to wear masks (as seen) and lied about being tested.  Trump was then hospitalized less than a week later... almost succumbing to CORONAVIRUS	-1
Trump was prolly interrupting so much to distract what's being said in Biden's ear piece xD	-1
i wonder how would have this debate went if it was trump vs obama.	-1
This moderator seems to side with the vice-president.	-1
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gas-consumption-by-country This chart shows the gas consumption globally.  USA has 328 million ppl in it, China 1.3 billion add Russia u see my point.

Re-elected by Trump Court ruling. Just watch. Almighty God said that he was electing Trump. If you just re-elect Trump, their evils won't come out. You allow these things. It is a plan to bring the evils of the Democratic Party and the media to the surface. Trust me. I will see it clearly.  트럼프 법원 판결로 재선 됩니다. 그냥 지켜보시면 됩니다. 전능하신 하나님께서 트럼프를 당선 시킨다고 말씀 하셨습니다. 트럼프를 그냥 재선 시키면 저들의 악들이 들어나지 않기에 이런 일들을 허락하시는 겁니다. 민주당과 언론들의 악들을 수면위로 만천하에 드려 내시려는 계획이시구요. 믿으십쇼. 여러분들 두 눈으로!!!  똑똑히 볼 것입니다.	-1

Biden is f*cking useless, and having looked at other videos of him of how much of an incompetent talker he is, the man is going senile !? he's not fit to be a president. There's no way he got to this position on his own steam, he's a puppet and is being carried by those behind him. There is total voter fraud going on, it's so obvious, and the truth will prevail.	-1

After seeing how trump can't stay on topic and goes over time, there's still people who supports him. When did America get dumber?	-1

Is it just me or does the moderator’s voice sound auto-tuned ?	-1
At 45:13 : “The second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject, so let’s try to be serious about it”      *says it with a smile*	-1
Chris Wallace is a Democrat that clearly dislikes Trump. He picks Biden up and carries him through the debate.	-1
Trump knew even during the first debate he was going to lose. That’s why he behaved once again badly. Welcome President Joe Biden!🥳🇺🇸👏👏	-1
This may have been a disaster debate but I’ll still keep these words with me up until Jan 20th. 1:52:15 - 1:53:13  🇺🇸 Keeping the faith 💙	-1

Trump killed 200K people in 7 months he, failed as to protect american citizens they told him beforehand but, he failed as a leader...	-1
The most satisfying thing about Biden winning is that Trump had zero respect for Biden.  Despite his rhetoric, he actually respected Hillary.  He had zero respect for Biden.  He never calls him “VP Biden” or anything...only “Joe.”  And Joe took him down.  Fuckin right Joe.	-1
Trump has been saying they would cheat for 3 years! The left SUCKS!	-1

"Trump has ruined the Bronx accent (or whatever part of New York that is? I don't mind being corrected) for me. ""They-uh"" instead of ""their""; ""Yo-ah"" instead of ""your"". And so on. Eventually someone cool will come along who has one, and this can be repaired. But that sound in Trump's mouth is obnoxious, unintelligent, inflammatory, etc. etc."	-1

57:22 “I’ve got to respond to that” the saddest most worried face I’ve ever seen. I’m so thankful he won 🙏🏼❤️❤️💙	-1
Trump wrote zero notes during the debate. Shows his lack of intelligence, unwillingness to wait to speak, can't construct sentences and doesn't have well thought out points.	-1
They should've mute Trump when he tried to interrupt, so Biden could actually speak. Also this moderator is incapable and isn't doing his job right. As an Dutch/European it's actually sad to see how inhumane this debate turned out, anyone with common sense wouldn't have vote for Trump.	-1
Never in all my time have I been witness to such arrogance.  Trump refuses to allow them people to consider a different perspective to his myopic thinking.  His 'knowledge' is clearly pretentious.	-1
1:45:50	302
Absolutely annoying this guy  Oh my goodness .I never saw anyone interrupting so many times. 🤯🤯🤯🤯	-1
We non-americans found this very entertaining.	-1
he distorted him in seconds lol 😂 at 28:00	-1
job biden ... happy you took over trump is out thank god ...	-1
Are people stupid? They think Biden is now officially the president.	-1
The bast part, finally Mr. Biden says “will you shut up man” 😂😂😂. Oh I was waiting for it for so long. Btw this debate was so unprofessional it’s a disgrace.	-1

Worlds worst leader is still alive.Mr.Trump.I wish you go to hell immediatly.  Its unbearable to watch him, listen to him.Leave alone his actions.  How can some one elect a person like him as President.  He is a born Rich.So cannot understand the ethics and pain.	-1
The moderater is kinda bias.	-1
I'm not an American, however after watching this, I can see how much Trump actually cares about his country and the people.  It's a shame how there are so many people who dislike him just because of who he is... People say they hate him just because... It makes no sense 🤷‍♀️	-1
trumps just a walking fox news talking point	-1
🎞 you won't BELIEVE what they have planned for us! https://youtu.be/UJ8b3d7LD2I	-1

AHHH, neither side is brilliant, especially after just saw an AOC video.....they both look like little kids fighting over time, with Trump winning in brute force, and I keep waiting for some brilliant moment from Joe..... but none so far > _ <	-1
1:15:42 look at Biden and Trump’s faces!  ROFL 🤣	-1
why did they mute the moderator?	111
"you could just see Biden's eyes light up the moment they asked if Trump would condemn white supremacists, and his brain was like ""Oho! Here's an opportunity!""  And while that was politically crafty overall, it's not as if he wasn't showing a fair point. I don't know if Trump is TRULY racist or not, I don't think I ever will be able to conclude as much unless I can read that idiot's mind. But he definitely has racist supporters which he refuses to condemn because he's afraid of making his base hate him.  That's why he seems racist overall, he has too much of an arrogant need for attention and that's caused him to side with racists in order to keep that attention and ego stroking."	-1
Moderator: what do you believe about the science of climate change Trump: I think that Obama sucks	-1

"I'm only watching these now after he's fired.  I simply couldn't watch it during because I was concerned I might punch my screen.  Watching it now I'm reminded of arguing with a child.  I totally kept expecting Trump to pull out the old ""I know you are but what am I"" or ""nu-uh!"""	-1
If Trump DID get elected president again: *328 million people have left the chat*	-1
"30:14 ""debate"" starts"	85
Maybe Trump should become a Comedian, cuz clearly he ain't good at being a President.	-1
1:52:18 I love how he spoke directly to the people. It says a lot about where his interests lie.	-1
no matter what, I think that the most important thing to do as a president, it's to face the problem called covid. Trump has done a horrible job with it. Because of his recklessness and his arrogance, thousands of Americans died. Had he been worried about covid as he should have been. Maybe half of those people would still be with us today. Biden on the other hand, he wants to make dealing with covid his first priority. And if you ask me, saving lives is far FAR more important than anything else at the moment.	-1

President Donald Trump, you will win the Creator’s permission. Do not be afraid if everyone stands against you. You must lead America or you will collapse. I swear by God they deceived you with the elections, but they cannot laugh at the Creator because he decided to lead America for 4 years again. I warn you, the American people, before disaster strikes your heads.	-1

Bidon: can you just- Donald trump: Keeps interrupts and yells Bidon: please just chill- Donald trump: Keeps- ugh you get it Bidon:smiles  Donald trump: shuts up	-1
Biden at 44:47-45:06... when you realize you’re debating a man with the temperament of a two year old. How arrogant is Trump feeling now with President Elect Biden about to deliver the eviction notice?	-1
stump	-1
Look at Trump and you will have a good insight into the mind of a pure narcissist. Just lies lies lies and interrupting the other person to show dominance. This is not a person who has solutions to anything.  Im glad the majority of Americans saw what this fucking assclown stands for and rejected him.	-1
"32:27 ""President Trump in the first segment you go first, 2 minutes"" What actually Trump heard: ""President Trump, in the first until the last segment you go first, forever"""	-1

Who's here after Joe Biden won the election?	126
Coming from a rabbit hole of watching past debates this is the most polarizing debate I’ve seen yet. From the COVID-19 precautions to the lack of basic respect from the one term president trump. I’m sad that as a nation we came to this but hopeful that our new president elect Joe Biden can change the course of this disenfranchisement.	-1
now that mr. biden is president-elect i can watch finally watch this comedy skit without feeling bad 🥳	-1
You can say whatever you want about Joe Biden, but the man has volumes of class over Donald Trump.	-1
The fact we had a president like this for 4 years is crazy, hes literally bullying the moderator. Hes Arguing with the moderator. Thank god we have President BIden coming to office	-1

Prepared for Joe Biden to fuck up America Donald Trump isn’t the nicest person but a tough leader, which you need. Joe Biden is A nice person, but is kind of a weak person  Mike Pence strong leader, basically a nicer version than Trump  In conclusion, the left and the right are pretty bad.	-1

RECOGIENDO CON EL SÉPTIMO SELLO William Soto Santiago. Domingo, 26 de abril de 1998 (Segunda actividad) Ciudad de México, México  ¿Para qué envía Su Ángel Mensajero? Para mostrarle a Su Iglesia las cosas que deben suceder pronto. ¿Y por qué Cristo, el cual prometió dar a conocer estas cosas, por qué Él mismo no las da a conocer? Pues Él mismo las da a conocer pero por medio de carne humana, por medio de Su Ángel Mensajero. Esa es la forma en que Jesucristo ha estado manifestado de edad en edad, en la primera edad, segunda, tercera, cuarta, quinta, sexta y séptima, y también es así para la Edad de la Piedra Angular. Y por esa causa es que por medio de Su Ángel Mensajero es que son dadas a conocer todas estas cosas que deben suceder pronto; porque siempre Cristo ha usado un ser humano, un hombre, desde que Él, del Día del Pentecostés hacia acá, ha estado manifestado en la Tierra en Espíritu Santo, en el Nuevo Testamento, durante la  Dispensación de la Gracia, y así es para la Dispensación del Reino también. Como también hizo en la Dispensación de la Ley y en dispensaciones anteriores a la Ley, siempre estuvo velado y revelado por medio de un ser humano, de un hombre, y por medio de ese hombre cumplió lo que Él prometió para cada tiempo https://youtu.be/md6uy7I9rjk	-1

The fact is we people don’t know who to vote for because we don’t know what is good for the country! Most people just vote for what it benefits them, not for what it benefits the country!	-1

Funny the moderator was actually from Fox news.. Why did I just realize this? Anyways he wasn't biased towards Trump at all like you would think a typical fox reporter would be like. In fact, he was quite the opposite.	-1
Okay but can we just talk about the end part real quick. Joe and Jill have the sweetest relationship ever	-1
Both Baldwin and Carrey are quite funny, but I think their humour is a little too childish here.	-1

"I'm not American.  But I pray that trump wins the election, trump has stood up, for the country, translating covid 19 is unintended, the whole world is affected. Don't blame trump Trump stood up, reflected on social evils, Trump fought against the journalists and the journalists avenged, don't trust the news and journalists ! Don't vote biden, he's a loser, he's dependent on China, causing the world to stall. THE WORLD DOES NOT ACCEPT ""BIDEN"". American friends, please be alert and think when you vote.

All trump ever does is humiliate and demean biden. What a narcissistic sociopath	-1
When you see a clown and biden debate...mary trump was right about the toxic positivity with this guy. Cannot believe he's a head of state. Omg. If trump can become president, anyone can tbh	-1
Alright, now that Trump’s lost.....  Let’s do this.	-1

This was actually the best debate in the history of presidential debates. No one watches the previous boring debates but this is just funny as hell.	-1
"Joe started stuttering when Trump said ""that's not on the ballot. How do you know what's on the ballot?"" Hmmm maybe because Joe was in his basement making fake ballots 🤔"	-1

Biden sucks	361
When a presidential debate is entertaining, even hilarious at times, something has gone seriously wrong.	-1
Sorry mr Biden but the elections have been tampered with. There are voices around saying that if Biden wins people over age 45 will go to paid retirement immediately leaving more work for youths . Im afraid that such endorsement is considerated stealing the elections. I wont mind to retire early but Im neither desperate or a sucker not believing that would happen. I don't know the motive behind when we all suckers in such winning endorsement but that is stealing the elections .  Certainly a fresh start.	-1
The moderater probably needed a drink	-1
Even an ordinary person in a country in the Middle East has found that the Democrats have stolen the American people's vote and replaced it with a fraudulent one in favor of Joe Biden, which will tarnish their reputation in the US Federal Court and the US Supreme Court.  They spent to make this fraud real, and because Mr. Trump found out, they delayed the vote count to make it look normal.🇮🇷🇱🇷	-1
trump; talking over Biden and Chris Biden: will you shut up man. #Bidenharrris2020	-1

Omg I laughed so hard I drop kicked Donald trumps grandma and then fed her to squirrels #savetheturtles #dropkicked #worthit #deadgrandma	-1
I am very happy with my vote after watching this..	-1
"Trump did interupt from time to time, the most of his interupts happened in part 1. Then he stopped. Biden did interupt as well. Biden has noting to say the entire show but ""he has no plan."" Trump has bad manners but he has a point, and he makes it clear. Biden gets interupted sometimes yes, also the most of the time he talks bullshit. Trump: "" Ive done more in 47 months, then you in 47 years."" Biden: "" Juhvnpl... Look.... This man has no plan."" Only a stupid person can put this aside and focus on manners.Its Trump, in 4 years you should know how he ticks."	-1
Trump Was Right About Mail-In Ballots All Along , Months Before The Elections . Even Though Military Ballots Had Name Trump On Them , Votes In His Favour .	-1

trump kept interrupting Biden and he lied alot	-1
I feel like my dad right now, watching presidential debates	-1
1:53:28 regarding the fraud of mail-in ballots is going on right now Its as if Trump knew exactly how this was going to be played out. (And he did early and repeatedly predict this was going to mess when they decided this for the coronavirus)	-1
Trumps lie a lot vote biden	-1

I watched the entire thing, I have brain damage       Please like for my recovery	-1
😂😂	-1
This sounds like a cod lobby	209
It’s ridiculous to use the covid death count to blame Trump. Why not add the annual deaths cause by the flu to that as well? I don’t agree with everything Trump says or does but I also don’t like how his opponents are watching for any opportunity to put him under using any means. It’s nasty.	-1
Trump be roasting biden tho	-1
1:16:14   Trump: He stood up and went to Ukraine with a billion dollars Biden: That is absolutely not true	-1

"""Mr. President you're gonna be very happy"""	-1
Starts at 29:45	270
Trump says Biden graduated bottom of his class so he cant use the word smart with him. Millions of Americans graduate last every year perhaps they should be treated second class as well or as lesser citizens ! Hmmm by that logic those who graduated last from Havard should not even use the word smart with him.	-1
Old man yells at old man	-1
I don't how I resisted to punch my phone screen while hearing Trump interrupting Biden and the moderator every 2 seconds	-1
47 years the Biden was in the White Office he give us ObamaCare,Trump did nothing.	-1
Joe: wheres your tax returns? Trump: I PAID MILLIONS OF DOLLURS joe: where is it?, insyallah?  Muslims like that 1:07:24	-1

Trump: im not xenophobic, howdare you say that Trump 20 minutes later: China plauge, how dare China	-1
God knows the best	-1
This is nothing like when me and the boys debate ass over titles	-1
Why do soo many people vote for a guy like trump? I don't get it Could anyone pleeease explain it	-1
They succeeded in making each other look bad but failed at making themselves look good.	-1
Trump is awesome, God bless you😁😁 Biden you dont have good ideas	-1
Im watching while pretending they're in couples therapy 😅 This therapist is RUBBISH but it's a great teaching aid for what not to do in an argument with an abusive narcissist. Poor Biden didn't know enough about going grey-rock and cutting off the supply lol. If you know.. You know...	-1
God brought me here. I said “I sho wana watch something funny to do laundry..” and this was the first thing in my recommendations 😂🤣😂🤣 I ain’t quit laughing since I skipped through the first few minutes 😂🤣😂	-1
You know, maybe the real debate is wether this was worth it or not for the memes	-1

Just decided to watch this today and I now realize that a lot of people might be voting for Biden strictly because Trump is a pompous ass.	-1
"""will you shut up, man?"" -Biden 2020"	216
I want obama back😭😭😭I wish he could be our forever president!!!	-1
if you take this seriously, it is more stress than fun but since it is an important matter, one should try to take it with a grain of salt. My head hurts, how can they talk without getting thirsty.	-1
Donald Trump: It's China's fault Ppl from China (≈1393000000): SHUT THE HELL UP	-1

54:50	302
Like it or not, this debate is going to go down in history as a classic.	-1
I hate this comment section	-1
gotta love how incredibly immature Biden looks laughing at trumps points. How ignorant.	-1
Biden at 45:00  “ That was a really productive segment wouldn’t it” People laughing.   LOL this is literally the MOST HILARIOUS DEBATE EVER. I cried my butt off 🤣	-1
imagine trump , biden , and obama all in one room	-1
In Happy ti live in Italy and dont see this....	-1
37:30	302
Why Mr President? Sounds like something a child would call an adult. We don't say Mr Prime minister 😂	-1
This is the fall of trump he should have let Biden bury himself. I’m a hardcore trump fan but this was hard to watch. Trump made himself look like an ass. I never looked at him the same again. He was up there with a guy that’s famous for painting himself in a corner and he didn’t let him do it. Oh well it’s meant to be i guess.	-1
44:47 is iconic	-1
"2 vs 1, but yeah. ""Presidential debate"""	-1
this should be a documentary on netflix just about the debate. it is very interesting.	-1
27:47 don't need to thank me.	-1
Trump is being real pathetic here	-1
omg this is so funny😂😂	249
So apparently Trump doesn’t understand or is ignorant about covid-19	-1
Joe Binden	103
This is how I debated in English class when I was 16... so cringe...	-1
This is the worst election ever in history.  You don't want to vote for a Chump! But your alternative isn't much better.  Put Barney the dinosaur in the Election and in the White House!  Remove these 2 fools!!  💵💶💷💰is stronger than anything, it's a dangerous motive!  That's why they are all there, from pre to post president.  They aren't there to make a difference or for the good of the people.  They're there because of the 💵💶💷, and for themselves.  They already start getting paid when they're doing their campaigns and getting donations, thats just the tip of the cake.	-1
41:10 JESUS TRUMP	12
magical moment at 44:46	-1
If i got a vote every time someone was interupted,today I would be the president instead if them	-1
biden trying not to laugh is this funniest thing ever LMAOAOAOAOOA	-1
Biden:I tell you why I’m a good candidate  Trump interrupts:.joe your tie is crooked,your not American	-1
I am not American but I see that trump is being childish	-1

Right now:   - Almost 23 million Americans are on unemployment - Nearly 1 in 5 small businesses have closed their doors - Millions of people are at risk of being evicted   We simply can’t afford another four years of Donald Trump. #BidenHarris2020  #Biden  #elections2020	-1

I mean just the fact that the actual debate got 15 million views and the snl debate parody got 28 million views just says it all for the country. 🙄😟😬🙄	-1
I Can't imagine how could a man who  doesn't listen to others and show no respect to the interviewer can serve the position of president for a full term, this is rediculous. Biden obviously the suitable option, otherwise the state would be ruined under the administration of Trump	-1
Trump's vocabulary is very limited and it is noticeable. I would at least like the president to sound smarter than myself or an Instagram influncer.	-1
I don't get comedy central right now so I'm here	-1
50:10  I’m sorry but, it’s not Trumps fault people died from corona.   So, if Biden 2020 ends up being a thing, here’s what I gotta say, “Hey look, you folks at home, how many of you woke up this morning and had a chair, perhaps with someone, but that someone lost their job because of Biden. And maybe that job is what was sustaining the family. And maybe even the person who lost their job was the only person working for the family, because someone, or maybe more than one, died because of COVID-19. Maybe this Christmas a family was wanting a really nice new Christmas tree, but now they can’t until they find a new job, and they may not even be able to find a better or even job with what they had before. This could happen to me. Also the socialism, haha. That’s crazy. Dems want Socialism, no electoral college, no guns, no oil industry, LGBTQ recognition, abortion, and BLM. So in other words they want Venezuela, a corrupt government, so protection, a butt ton of people to lose their jobs, support for a mental illness called gender dysphoria, killing of innocent babies, and support for a chaotic group of people who don’t believe in all lives matter and have killed more police than police have killed them and who have been in a lot of raiding looting and no peaceful protest, oh and I forgot they also want to remove a lot of history, and isn’t if odd that most of democratic history is them being really bad and messing up America. Back to the oil stuff, a lot of other jobs rely on the oil industry. And before you say, “Biden said he just wants to give less money to the oil industry, which he may be, a lot of jobs have bosses that say if Biden follows through with this fracking stuff, a lot of their workers will be laid off. This is bad for our country, can’t you see. I speak from knowledge and from my heart. I don’t really care how bad Trump may be, I know that Trump hasn’t absolutely destroyed America or we would be in chaos. With Biden, man, America will be destroyed if he follows through with anything he believes in. I know I can’t change the election, whatever happens happens, but I still want to give my thoughts, so that maybe in the future people will be able to actually want to improve America. I speak these thoughts not to be rude towards a party, or be super positive to another party, but to possibly help people realize what is wrong so we can do things right. I am only a kid. A middle class kid. I will say my age is above 12 but below 20. I hope future generations realize what the democrats want to do in order to corrupt the American government and turn it full blue. Whether your republican and democrat, you should understand what I am saying. I hope. Have a wonderful day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, year, and know that we may have just caused 2021 to be worse than 2020. I just wanted to get away from 2020, as did a lot of other people, probably you reading this too, but I guess it won’t happen. Unless Trump pulls it off in the end. Have a great day or night. And I need to make this clear too, which I wish I had put more emphasis on, but know that God is what we need, and that God is the best and only solution to this and everything. 😇👨‍👩‍👦👨‍👩‍👧👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👧👩‍👦👩‍👧👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👧‍👧👨‍👦👨‍👧👨‍👧‍👦👨‍👦‍👦👨‍👧‍👧🇺🇸❤️ Think about God, Families, America, and The Future.”  From,    The Konqor (That’s not my real name btw 🙃)	-1

Trump: I've shut down the economy, he didn't want to do so. We closed down and have 200k deaths but it would've been 2 mil if we didn't. Also Trump on the same stage: He wants to shut down the economy, we can't do that, the country needs to run, closing down the economy will destroy the country.

"I don't know, is there any good alternative? I reluctantly voted for Trump.  As a working-class man who has gone to university and spent time suffocated by woke liberals, I found Trump very refreshing even though I still think he's a con man - like Biden.  Ordinary people like me (that is, the majority of the population) weren't welcome on campus or anywhere that capitulated to WOKE liberal groupthink. It's not that we even had strong views. We simply weren't interested in uncritical politically correct middle-class social etiquette or political platitudes. Of course, racists weren't welcome either - thankfully. However, WOKE liberals have become so insular and uncritical that decent people outside their ranks who have more complex (less black and white) views of the world are considered to be in the army of Satan.  They are so quick to scream ""Witch!! Witch!! Unclean pagans!"" at those they don't understand.  Their mode of thinking is just as uncritical as that of the hardened nationalist or religious fundamentalist. I suppose Trump is a counterbalance to asinine WOKE hegemony which has already done a lot of damage to the quality of education children and adults receive on campus. The very place where we form the next generation.  I hope in the future we won't need to vote for someone like Trump."	-1

"PLEASE SHARE THIS ARTICLE... Perhaps you have not yet understood what awaits us:  The roadmap issued by the Government of Canada Planning Committee is as follows and will apply to all countries of the world:  Progressively establish a second lockdown on a continuous basis first in the metropolis and then in the suburbs by November 2020 accelerate the construction of the isolation / quarantine camps by December 2020 the exponential increase in cases and deaths is expected by the end of November 2020 (obviously on FARLOCCHI data expressly used for MEDIATIC TERRORISM)  2. a second complete and total lockdown much more severe than the first, for the end of December 2020 and the beginning of January 2021 The reform and transformation of the unemployment benefit system for the transition to a universal income, expected for the first quarter of 2021 this will serve to make you slaves of the system and completely dependent on it and certainly not to make you live, introducing digital currency and therefore with prepaid cards  3. The planning of a mutation of the Covid 19 virus with another virus called Covid 21 that will lead to a third wave with a much higher rate of infection and deaths, for February 2021 the ""new cases"" of hospitalization for Covid 19 and Covid 21 and if they don't find them they will create them!  4. Improved lockdown restrictions called third lockdown will be implemented with the total travel ban also between cities and countries, second quarter 2021 The inclusion in the universal income project, for the second quarter 2021 The planned interruption of supply chains and stocks, with great economic instability, expected for the end of the second quarter of 2021  5 Deployment of military personnel in metropolises and main roads to establish checkpoints and limit travel, in the third quarter of 2021  6. Parallel to this program, there has been talk of an unparalleled economic transition in which to force citizens.  7. To compensate for the international economic collapse, the federal government will offer a cut in debt, personal debt, loans, mortgages, thanks to the IMF as part of the global debt reset program, in exchange citizens will forever lose their private property of any property and will have to participate in the covid 19 and covid 21 vaccination program thanks to which they will be able to travel even in full lockdown with a health pass for Canada. The same is true for all countries of the world.  8. Committee members asked who will own the confiscated assets, and what will happen to the lenders: the answer was only that the IMF's debt reset program will take care of all the details. Absolute nothing.  9. Other members wondered what will happen to citizens who refuse to participate in the IMF World Debt Reset and the Health Pass, and the response was that the members of the Committee must come up with a plan to do everything possible to prevent it from happening. never refusal, and that goes in the interest of all citizens to participate.  10. Those who refuse will live indefinitely locked up, and those who refuse the World Debt Reset program will be considered a public health risk, and will be locked up forever if they do not accept the debt cancellation program.  This is what was released by a member of the Canadian Liberal Party who attended a meeting of the Canadian Government's Technical Programming Committee. This is the program for all countries around the world.  All members who objected or asked questions were ignored.  When I told you that the point nobody wants to talk about is money, but that is what moves the evil?  And that it is this that must be reformed in the sense of cash, distribution, and not debt to third parties.

"""Here's a deal""     - Joe Biden"	359
there is an election going on right now and people are small minded enough and not educated correctly that they are voting for Joe biden, who lets riots happen freely, and Donald Trump stops them whenever possible, and Joe Biden is a supporter of abortion, which regardless of what anyone comments, or the hate i get from this, abortion is the killing of a baby. If you actualy look it up on articles and other things online, you can find out that most abortions take place after the baby is not a what they like to call ''fetus'' anymore, its a baby with arms, legs, feet, and a head. But everyone doesn't like hearing that because its the truth, and they want to make it seem okay to keep doing what they are doing. Hate me for being a Trump supporter, Hate me for being against anarchism,  Hate me for being against abortion, Hate me for saying its wrong to have kis that are just 5 years old come on tv shows, and other videos an talk about what men they find attractive, when they have barely just got out of pre-school. I speak truth and you should too. Vote for Trump 2020.	-1

I bet when the moderator was young he would have been perfect to cast as the kid who's always getting his head flushed down the toilet and wedgied. Now he looks perfect for the role of the teacher who gets bullied by the kids. Biden just looks like a pervert who's suffering from dementia so he spends alot of time staring at the sun fantasising about being a telly tubby. Trump is a majestic demi God of the owl people.	-1

I mean this is worst than children you did this I did not   yes you did so what    I mean wth??	-1
Both of them seem sus, who should i vote??	-1
What if I told you the left wing and the right belong to the same bird. 🤨	-1
The reason why Ithink Trump may win again is his simple understandable comment use of assurance and creative literature skills in producing simple statements.   unless the US us upset with Trump, he god Steel companies working again, hes cibsideringbthe black vote.  If anything Ivthink hes not driven the neo conservative agenda enough  and tezched as many people as he could...that maybe his major weakness.  Bidden, seems to lack a novel idea or concept the public can empathise with or empirically see created...bearing in mind the Democrat like UKs labour, had so much time and money, and no innovation was in place for anything...	-1
Bidden will be lucky in that maybe the anger, fear or confusion the Democrats created is well past...but he seems tired to me...I think even here in the UK the centre left seem far far to weak with no heavy hitters on the front line...and wont beat a neo conservative government...	-1
"""Mr. President. Mr. President! MR. PRESIDENT!!!!!!!"" Like my God let Joe Biden speak!!!!! Even if you don't agree, just be civil and shut up!!!!!!!!! And then he wants to be so arrogant as to not admit to his unprofessional behavior, and blame Joe for doing what he himself did. Joe has been nothing but respectful the whole time!!!!"	-1

Son of a Vietnam Veteran addressing the Bullshit VA remark by the Goofy Oompa Loompa. The state of affairs is FAR worse now because of both Covid AND the Mission Act, than ever before. We've lost 90% of the care providers at our local VA. My dad has a serious condition--NOT Covid, thank whatever--and the PA he's been assigned is incompetent and refuses to see him in office. We were told constantly by her to have him checked up at the mobile unit, as we live far from our main VA office.They were never there. We just found out that they never INTENDED to be there; they were pulled out of commission as long as Covid is going around. We tried to take him to the ONLY local VA Approved clinic in town; they have no handicap accessibility, which he needs. My sister, who is largely my father's care provider, was told by VA that they had no control over that. The clinic that are APPROVED by VA are NOT REGULATED BY VA. Think about tHAT for a moment. She was told by the VA to contact the clinic and push to have handicap facilities implemented. In other word, they wanted my sister to do THEIR FUCKING JOBS FOR THEM! Because they're NOT culpable in the maintenance of these 'VA Approved' facilities. Think about THAT for a minute. I HATE Biden, but my HATRED for Trump is FAR more grievous. FUCK YOU, DONALD TRUMP!	-1

As a democratic state I can say that we are completely shut down. Locals can’t do anything or go anywhere. So many people don’t have jobs because they won’t reopen the state. But when the tourist come here they can do whatever they want. We were masks all the time and we don’t go anywhere. We need to reopen.  I say Hawaii for trump Democrats are keeping the locals trapped and nobles making many people homeless.	-1
"Watching this trainwreck for the first time while waiting for the Country to decide between two Losers. But damn, Biden, you would show stronger if you didn't make certain gaffes. ""Of the 200,000 that died on his watch, how many survived?"" LMFAO Smooth, dude. Real smooth."	-1

I can not stand when people interrupt other people. It shows that they are forcing their opinions on other people and making unnecessary comments shows the weakness in their own arguments.

We need to work together and listen to each others differences.	-1
I hate this.  I teach Middle School and they’re doing a school election and I refuse to let them watch these debates. We watch Obama/Romney most of the time, although we’ve watched some older ones too. These are shameful.	-1

trump is SO MF ANNOYING won’t even let the man talk. He is like a child & so unprofessional. That is just sad. Making up lies just to make himself look good. I’m sorry but idk how y’all b voting for him. Cant think of one thing he has done for us these past 4 years. Families don’t even be together anymore , people dying everyday, and even riots are occurring. Could NEVER & will NEVER go for trump. He is a big disappointment. His career is over.  #biden💙	-1

With Trump as president we’ve been able to provide ventilators to other country’s and save millions of lives. With a Democratic president where all your tax dollars stay within your own country will be one of many, many examples that proves our nation is selfish and ungodly. Supporting abortions and letting prisoners roam free will not help either. With Biden as president, you’re f**n doomed no matter what political party represents your beliefs and ideals.  Hint* At least as a republican you’re able to make your own decisions and it be legal at the same time!!  🇺🇸 🦅✝️	-1

Black lives matter ✊🏿✊🏾	-1
"Biden is a really scary joke.  He just told the President of the United States to ""shut up"" because Trump was asking legitimate questions (aggravatingly sure) but Joe is an idiot and can not handle Trump's toughness,  abrasiveness or whatever you want to call him.  Trump speaks clearly and concisely and does not dance around any questions the likes of pathetic Chris Wallace can ask.  GO TRUMP!!"	-1
If this should be on Netflix should it be categorized as drama or as comedy?	-1
Donald Trump has done so much for black communities. Research Trump's First Step Act, which freed many African-Americans from prison with non-violent offenses. Research Trump's Platinum plan which focuses on boosting black businesses and jobs. Trump's policies benefit EVERYONE economically speaking. Before the Coronavirus lockdowns, poverty was at it's LOWEST LEVEL in the history of the country. Vote for Donald J. TRUMP!	-1
God Bless - Joe Biden	-1
ALIEN FOR PRESIDENT 👽 👽 👽	-1
I misread the title as Donald Duck vs Joe Biden	-1
Just want to add, in Australia we have what we call Medicare which I believe is the Obama care equivalent, we also still have private insurance, you don’t have to have it, it’s a choice. Medicare is amazing, we have access to good health care, no matter how poor you are. Private insurance gives you a few extras like your own private room in a private hospital, you can choose your surgeons etc. I don’t have private insurance because I don’t feel like I need to our public health care is great. Very affordable if not free.	-1
Im not even american but this is entertaining for me	-1
The way he say it’s China fault I want to punch that orange in that face😃	-1
I'm from South Africa watching this and the most entertaining part is the COVID-19 section. We were already in a hard lockdown and they played Trump's speech on the South African news channels where he was talking about COVID-19 being a myth	-1
SHUT UP ORANGE	-1
I’m embarrassed. Smh.	-1
Is it me or Biden is giving gen z vibes?	-1
"""it is what it is because you are who you are""  DAMN LEFT HIM SPEECHLESS!! GO OFF BIDEN PERIODT."	-1
Trump must be the president again,he gain piece of the world!	-1
Biden kept saying we are poor! How is he poor?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣	-1
Trump lie	-1
Long live the American Communist Revolution !!!https://youtu.be/IwmxEEe8P1M	-1
i went here as a joke	-1
As an American, this is an embarrassment	-1
Istg if Trump could just shut up for a second and let Biden talk. Goodness, so disrespectful.	344
That orange man doesn’t have any manners, no respect either......	-1
I love how Biden keept smiling when trump talked bc he couldnt take Trump seriously. I WOULDNT EITHER LMAO	343
Oh wow ..how about just let people talk when its their turn,  just shhhhhh!	-1
WHY ISNT ANYBODY SAYING BIDEN2020 CMON NOW	-1
Two old idiots arguing. But I really hope Trump wins. Biden is an asshole. Trump is the better kind of asshole.	-1
Well, was enough to see how their wives were behaving at the end. More than enough to understand. 🙈	-1
They should just mute their mics when it is not their turn to speak. Can't even focus on what the hell they are talking about.	133
Lmao this is such a good show! Imagine if they were running for president?	-1
Wow I have never been more confused because a stupid orange bimbo won't shut his mouth for others to speak	-1
Trump is such a fucking sneaky little orange mallrat!!	-1
I genuinely feel if you vote for Trump your mentally wrong in your head  like do you hear him speaking like oh my goshhh	-1
54:53 I can't stand trump but that was pretty funny 😂	-1
All lives matter please listen this song https://youtu.be/DoCcyDx6aK4	-1
Here’s a fun drinking game!  Any time someone interrupts take a shot.	-1
This is like elementary schoolers arguing over being class president and actually like they would control the country	-1
Biden kept interesting trump because he knew he couldn’t defend himself and Biden couldn’t even answer the question and he made up fake numbers ahha dumb ass	-1
Anyone Today!	-1
They need to bring in Michelle Obama for president	-1
Biden is so good. Trump is so bad	356
Can we have them raise hands	-1
Trump needa to shut up	269
37:56 hahaha they acting like three year olds	-1
I think it’s so unprofessional that Trump keeps poking fun on Biden’s son that has drug addiction.	-1
What a JOKE	230
I hate how Biden tries to pull at the heart strings just for your vote and your vote only. He doesn’t care for us. No politician cares for us.	-1
How are we supposed to believe either of them when they’re both calling each other a liar lol	-1
This is the best comedy show I’ve seen in a while	274
"★★★★★ Everybody cares about America,. Trump only cares about his own status and statue. He never care about the nation spread of coronavirus in winter. He'll simply say, ""hey dude, come what may, it's not my fault though..."" https://youtu.be/ouZjTuoOmoM ★★★★★"	-1
I went to Joe Bidens house. He lives 10 minutes from me in Greenville, Delaware https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzIrFmYL5yk	-1
This was awsome. I loved the fighting between don and the mod. The mod was total friends with biden.	-1
It's like they have 30 minutes to ramble on at the beginning, but the candidates don't have time to offer a decent response.	-1
Untill seeing this  video I had no idea that the present USA president is a  RUDE, INCONSIDERED, SELFISH, and EGOMANIAC of the worst kind.	-1
its starts at 27:48	270
Trump won this one hands down	-1
It's clear that Trump is not a true politician and doesn't have the best interest of the American people in his mind and heart. To him it is a popularity contest. He only really wants the title. It's time to have someone in office that will help people that need it.	-1
More jobs was created in the final 3 years of Obama's 2nd term than the 1st 3 years of Trump's term.	-1
He's barricading himself in the white house!	-1
That was painful to watch	227
"28:23 The rest of the debate: ""MR. PRESIDENT WAIT YOUR TURN!"""	-1
Trump acts like a fool.  Please end this White House Reality Joke Show Trump created.  4 years was enough of him. Vote Biden who is more deserving to be the President.	-1
I am looking at this debate again.  Trump is a pig and can't let anybody else have a say.  Joe Biden did the best he could and I challenge anybody to remain calm under those circumstances.  Chris Wallace was a terrible moderator and let Trump go on and on over the top.	-1
two kids fighting against on fortnite and arguing Parent- The moderator	-1
Joe baiden for president . Not this secularist bussiness man who does not know about humanity. Go to hell mcdonald.hehe	-1
Trump exposed Biden's extremist radicalism!	-1
30:48 Trump: good in every way Biden: mmm	-1
Humanity is doomed, we can’t seem to differentiate between a puppet show and politics.	-1
1:14:46 spechles😂😂	225
"""It's hard to get any word with this clown"" lmao, this is completely insane. I applaud Biden for not walking off the stage. Just by that, he has guts to be the president. Totally managed to hold up against this yellow high school bully idiot."	-1

Dear Donald,   I am trying to see things from your point of view but I can't stick my head that far up my ass. Are you always so stupid or is it only on special occasions?	-1
I ask plz that Anyone still Undecided to Vote Democratic to keep Democracy Alive. Republican Corruption, Evil and, Hatred for Democracy and Freedom has gotten totally obvious. Look it up and plz read about It. Texas is the hardest State to Vote in, if Dems lose it it will probably be from Voter Suppression. Huge Lines (taking up to 7 hours to vote) and one drop box per County in places likes Houston you have what's plain Severe Corruption, Malice and Hatred for Democracy. Same things are almost just as bad in the States of Georgia and Wisconsin.	-1
this will be pure comedy so long as Trump doesnt lose......Sleepy Joe wants to make everyone poor and keep all the money for his family!! #Trump2020	-1
This is so funny omg	282
go biden	360
Trump for President,no judge it is your choice.	-1
Trump didn’t even allow him to speak out ,he seems to be so nervous .	-1
Hello everyone! I just want to remind you that you are special, and to have a great day! You're awesome!	-1
Jesus, that poor Moderator	132
GOOO! TRUMPT TRUMP TRUMP! = NO! to sex maniac!	-1
Would anybody care to explain why Biden struggles to form a coherent sentence https://youtu.be/AV5HbLI_TdM?t=12	-1
Remember to get your friends, family and neighbors to vote IN-PERSON on Election Day, DO NOT vote-by-mail because if you do, there is a chance that someone could STEAL your VOTE (Most likely a democrat.); and would get rid of it, therefore not making your vote counted. So please, vote regardless and if there’s someone you know that wants to vote-by-mail despite how hard you tried to convince them to vote in-person, then be sure to be on the lookout for anyone that might try to steal their vote because their vote is CRUCIAL for this election. So please, just vote no matter what. 🗳 🇺🇸🎉TRUMP 2020! 🎉🇺🇸 🔴RED WAVE INCOMING! 🔴  Also, if you want to use my comment to spread this information, then go ahead. I don’t really care if someone copies my comment, I just want other people to realize why voting-by-mail isn’t really the best way to vote. But, still vote regardless.	-1
SYSTEMS NEEDED TO ELIMINATE COVID 19, A MUST HAVE FOR BUSINESS: Inside door business technology needed against covid 19 and any other: A/C fans that goes down/up in direction to the roof/floor. And A/C fans to pushes the air out from the doors where people go inside/outside Also self heat surfaces technology and complete light sanitizing system, both kills any germ/viruses instantly. Also air sanitizing/filtering/bacteria & virus killer that is connected to all A/C fans working 24/7  And finally blue light virus laser detector to target those who have any germs around their face/hands and body All this systems in place on EVERY LOCAL BUSINESS, plus advanced transparent mask with air intake/filtering WILL DEFINITELY DESTROY THIS AND ANY FUTURE PLANDEMICS. the development of these systems is a must have for every local business and indoor location.

Wat was that bullshit at the beginning I just want to see two old men trying to give each other a stroke	-1
Time stamp no?	-1
Trump is the biggest troll ever existed.	-1
The moderator would be a better president than both of them	-1
"Trump is a lot of things, but he isn't a politician. For those hoping Biden wins, I hope that if he wins, he'll be everything you wanted in a president. Trump has been under constant scrutiny for every reason under the sun. Had he been censored from the getgo and had Back to the Future 2 had a different villain, very few would find something to complain about. He doesn't speak a politician's language (aka bullshit lies disguised as confections with pretty packaging) he will speak lamens terms, although I will admit, sometimes it sounds like series of farts in a baron cornfield after harvest. Before Trump, people were against most things political, control of the people etc... Biden isn't your solution. Your tax dollars have been going down the crapper since time immemorial, and never before have news stations been so biased, enough to lie to everyone in order to shift the votes in the direction these elitist asswipes want it to go, and these puppeteers will pull any strings they have to to convince you that Trump has been a terrible president thus far, when that is simply not the case. The people who are causing division are far more terrible than any president. ""None of us is as dumb as all of us"""	-1
Democrats kill and humiliate African-Americans, Latinos, Biden nits. President trump is our President of America	-1

''WOULD YOU JUST SHUT UP MAN?!''  -Joe Biden	-1
(To Western Society) … I sent the attached file: ( The earth belongs to Allah ) This Is The Link :  ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OELmaJqTOuq4it-dmakqhsgzcT9qqIgR/view?usp=sharing ) to many idolatry temples in the world via the regular mail and online , and I will keep sending it and urging the real believers in Allah to send it until Allah concludes a predetermined matter, but before you read it I would like to talk to you… the politicians ( policymakers ) in Western society and in the same time to all people in Western society through this message , My words with you will be a four questions I will ask you and I will answer them on your behalf.  My first question is: Are you against violence and hatred speech and the factors and motives that incite violence and hatred?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!!  My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!!  My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!! My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!   Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated.  Now listen carefully what I am going to say ….. Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!. The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences. The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere.  Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God's existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !!  Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator.  No one can understand the God's Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic.  God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do))…………………………   Mazen Alargha	-1

When Joe Biden visited China as Vice President, he received a $ 1 billion investment in his son's investment company in exchange for allowing China to increase military pressure on the Senkaku Islands | Giuliani, the former mayor of NY, said.	-1
"Trump is one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States. Since he took office in 2016, Trump has bravely resolved the inequality trade deficit between the United States and China over the years, and encouraged the manufacturing industry to return to the United States. To increase employment opportunities and effectively solve the unemployment problem, only Trump can make the entire US economy grow, only Trump can fight Communist China, and only Trump can wipe out (Covid-19), ""make the American people great again"", the only one in 2020 Support President Trump's re-election in the United States 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 a successful presidential election."	-1
The debates in the comment section hits different	-1
The moderator is just there for comic relief	-1
Americans should select Trump, dont be blind!	-1

Speaking about the CDC , Why did the CDC drop the ball with testing kits?  That is why so many died.  The CDC is sucking money and wasting it, CDC needs to be defunded ...  CDC and WHO are in China’s back pocket eating everyone’s lunch...  The one thing CDC and WHO were paid to do and they dropped the ball and kicked the ball over to China.  China the ones that think forced organ harvesting is a cool thing to do to their citizens.   Nothing good about China .  Communism and socialism is for fools and for people  who do not know history...  socialism / communism they are both the same thing, in the end everyone loses accept the selfishly rich on the top with more money than brains...	-1

All I’m thinking about is how trumps tan had a very obvious line from white to orange.. he looks like how my foundation looks when it oxidizes 😂😂	-1
There is no way on earth Biden is fit to run the United States for 4 years, potentially 8. He's a frail old man who should be retired and enjoying his twilight years. Age is just a number but the man clearly wears his in his demeanor. I really don't think he would make it through term to be quite frank.	-1
This was the most insane debate Ive ever seen. They both acted so childish	-1

If u ask me trump lost because he is plain out rude and he is constantly interrupting and just hvaing all around no manners, unlike biden who speake when he is asked wnd is quietwhen asked to be. The host had to ask several times for him to be quite so biden could speak. I think hehas no manners.	-1
If this was an among us emergency meeting then this would be the only time I would vote for orange.	-1
Trump is a bit toxic with this and people who are this high up should me more professional	-1
34:50 No no, it’s around 50 - 120 people not counting elderly IF my research is correct, please do correct me if I’m wrong though!!	-1
I do enjoy a bit of humor in this stuff. I already knew where both candidates stood on the topics for The past 2 years now.	-1
I support neither of these people. Vote Dagoth Ur instead.  Why? Because:  What a fool you are!  I'm a god! How can you kill a god?!  What a grand and intoxicating innocence!  How could you be so naive?  There is no escape!  No recall or intervention can work in this place!  Come, lay down your weapons!  It is not too late for my mercy.	-1
Why does Biden forget half the things he is saying?	-1
Why are they comparing how many death of people under their watch? 😪	-1
who is here just to see Trump fuck up?	-1
Fyc	291
God that moderator is annoying, are they supposed to be debating him or each other?	-1
Parents need to teach their children not to interrupt others when they are speaking so we can actually have a conversation.  This is ridiculous.	-1
Biden: _says anything_  Trump: *Your free trial of speaking has expired.*	-1
They need an Italian grandma as the moderator lol	-1
Geeze, I heard this was bad, but I was not prepared. What a fustercluck. 😵	-1
How terrible😯	-1
I like how his kids are so focussed ..u can tell they are very very intelligent ppl ( Trumps Children )	-1
wait did Trump refer to Kamala Harris as Pocahauntus? Jesus	-1
Biden didn't even talk much, Trump is yelling all the time basically.	-1
I am support you Joe Biden✌👍	-1
"31 mins in Moderator  (about masks ) "" Your approaches are very different president Trump holding large rallys with crowds of thousands packed together , and vice president biden you were holding much smaller events "" Trump ""because no one will show up ""  Moderator laughs ... hahahaha"	-1
This moderator is soo sweet bless him x	-1
"Had to wait almost an hour into the debate for joe to say something besides ""trump is bad"" I'm all for replacing Trump but you're going to have to do better than this Democrats."	-1
This would go so well with popcorn	-1
The moderator should a mom who has spent the lockdown with her kids.	-1
This was outright painful to watch. Trump making an ass of himself is one thing, but for fuck's sake, _why was Biden egging him on?_ It would have been so much easier and more effective for his public image if he'd just followed the rules and let Trump do what he wants, giving him free reign to ruin his own image entirely on his own. US electoral politics are a shitshow.	-1
A person over 70 years old aiming to be president is pure greed and selfish....what is biden think he can do more?. Why he didn't do it before when he was younger..? Hahaha he is obviously senile haha	-1
Dudes a bitch why didn’t he tell trump to shut his damn mouth for a minute. All he does it talk and none of it makes sense!	-1
This  debate  thing is a joke ,all I heard  was two chickens cackling.	-1
Forget these 2. I say we need a funny president. Lets nominate Weirld Al. He would probably be better at the job then both these 2 combined.	-1
It's like watching 2 grown children, and the moderator is a teacher. Kids can you be quiet and let me talk.	-1
Fuckin love trump Lol. Legend. Jordan Belfort for president 2025	-1

"Don’t fall for Biden acting behavior. See how he talk directly to the camera. This is an acting behavior. He is manipulating you. He uses story telling to convince you hence the manipulation. He is lying. He is a satanic globalist with an hidden agenda of a great reset in order to destroy the nations including the US nation for the profit of the ultra class of nomad stateless men.  And enforce the NWO and the control of your family. He supports groups of people who think your children don’t belong to you parents but to the ""community"" they are evil. Fight them! Neutralize them! Vote! Vote #Trump2020"	-1

Where is Hunter. Hard to find an item made in the USA nowadays.  Trump will bring manufacturing and jobs back to the USA.  You don't need a magic wand to bring jobs back you need to negotiate fair trade agreements as Trump has done.

Donald gets so offended when the moderator says something that he hasn’t done well with. It’s like he thinks that he’s being picked on. I don’t understand because the moderator is asking the same level of questions to Joe. Both of them give me a headache.	-1
Biden makes me wanna punch him in the f! Face	-1
Wallace was so biased. So sad we can’t even have a fair debate.	-1
Entertainment👍👍👍	-1
All this debate is simply trump interrupting Biden. Biden not being able to give his points on the topics. Biden laughing at everything trump says. Its absolutely  childish. This is the most unprofessional presidential debate and it worries me .They need to pass a law saying anyone running for presidency  in the US should need to pass mental health exams or psychological and psychiatric evaluations.	-1

Biden looked weak and didn't answer anything about the scandal regarding his son and influence peddling. I thought President Trump came across a lot more presidential and used a lot more restraint in letting Biden lie his ass off.	-1

Мда, после этого я понял, что наши дебаты с Жириновским и прочими на федеральном ТВ не так уж зашкварны. Два старпёра кричат друг на друга: ты дурак. Наш ЦК КПСС по сравнению с этим был молодёжным клубом. А мы ещё над Черненко смеялись. Какая ирония. Запасаемся попкорном.	8

I think Trump should just enjoy his life and all his money and family instead of risk dying on the job during the next 4 years due to stress and his health problems. His first wife also recommended that for him. He has tried running a country for 4 years now so what thrill is left for him in the future? Why put up with all the crap?	-1

Absolute domination by mr president, woooosh. Creepy joe just got mutilated. Look  at Trump's elegance, watch his movement see it's a ballet at the machine.

This was horribly sad.  You do not bring up anyone's addiction. That was flat out wrong , hateful and very irresponsible.  Especially coming from a President.  Everything else was a huge sh!tshow if I ever saw one. I am deeply hurt as a person who has  had problem, fixed, but still an issue.	-1
Why is this like a comedy show?	-1

Trump is trying to express the voting process because he knows what's going to happen because they don't want him in office no more because he's doing his job and he's take care of his people and hes stepping on dirty money-hungry people's toes.. Biden is not worried about it because because faking it is in his favor.	-1
I lov u Trump. Keep fighting, keep interrupting I'm sorry ur alone up there.	-1
Can someone explain why only Biden and Trump debate? Im not American and im trying to figure it out, because i saw that in the voting tickets there are more than these two candidates (like Hawkings). So why all the publicity goes only to these two? Im really confused, because everywhere where they talk about US new president they say it will either be Biden or Trump. Please someone explainnn	-1

I really wish there was a discord or an app where it’s very strictly moderated and both sides can come together and just discuss everything from health insurance to civil rights to COVID. This would be the best most productive way to get through what we are going through as a country right now. And in all honesty, it’s what we need. At some point, this country has to get tired of fighting with itself.	-1
Biden is not against opening the economy..He is for opening CAUTIOUSLY..with science backed data and with proper health protocols in place. He is thinking twice and speaking once.	-1
I love how the mediator interrupts trump if he talks when biden is speaking but not biden.. stupid ass fake news just trying so hard to get trump out. Soo corrupt.	338
"So much for their ""UNFILTERED NEWS"" motto. They do not start their Trump Lansing, Michigan, until AFTER Trump plays videos clips showing Biden verbatim LIES about China, fracking, social security, and NAFTA. It is hard to believe C-Span turns their 'UNFILTERED NEWS' logo, into a palpable LIE. You can see what C-Span clipped out by viewing the link below. SHAME ON C-Span. https://tinyurl.com/CSPAN-FILTERStheNEWS"	-1
90% how can you tell such lie? You will lose money this is unrealistic.	-1
Biden: Number 1 number 2 number 3!!  Trump: No you were on number 2   Biden: No    💀💀💀💀💀	-1
can't wait to see the bad lip reading of this!!	69
Trump has serious issues. He is extremely childish. He won't even let Biden speak. Does it really matter what policies he supposedly  stands for if his character is reprehensible? YES your character as president MATTERS. He's an influence on our children and on our future...Open your EYES people.	-1
Debate starts at 27:48. You're welcome	84

This Trump is really rude and dictorial. He should let Biden complete his speech first, he keeps on interrupting and drowning his speech! Trump not only bully the world but also his own citizens.	-1

*****Antifa opposes tyrannical UnBiblical government that controls peoples and nation, subjecting them to constraints, that suppress peoples and their freedoms. Fascism is when the church of Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 join forces to eliminate all opposition. Antifa opposes, what God also opposes. In the scriptures cited, we see that there is a kingdom, that rules over other kingdoms. This is the Vatican city State, which it mentions in the scriptures as riding the Roman Empire. It has a King, which is the Pope. If you look at history, you will see that Popes have installed governments of the world. The Pope claims to be in the position of God's representative in the earth, but the scriptures cited show that God opposes this government church alliance. It mentions what the people of this city state wear, scarlet(Cardinals) and Purple(Bishops), which are the colors of the Catholic Church. Hitler and Mussolini were both Roman Catholic, and they joined with the church in exterminating their enemies. They started by creating gangs, that would destroy the property of Jews and those opposing their rulership. They smashed out all the store windows, burned and looted Jewish businesses. Like what is happening today. Before they blamed it on the Jews, today on Antifa and BLM, because they plan to slaughter them as they did the Jews. After breaking and burning their business and blaming the violence on the Jews, they started rounding up people under the guise of a Typus epidemic. For the protection of people, they started putting Jews in concentration camps, and today the same thing is happening, people being killed under the guise of a Corona virus. They plan to start putting people in to concentration camps soon. There is a fenced holding center near me, with communication and guard tower, and high fences. To my understanding there are concentration camps being built all over the world to deal with people who have learned about what Revelation/Apocalypse 17, 18 says. We see there, that it says, in this Church Government was found the blood of the prophets, holy ones, and all those who have been exterminated from the earth. People are being illegally forced to wear masks, so that those destroying property and committing violence can not be identified. They are setting up for the slaughter of BLM and Antifa for these crimes, just as Hitler, Mussolini did to the Jews. George Floyd was killed right in front of the world, by 4 police officers. They had called an ambulance, because there was a man in respiratory distress, and later they said he was in respiratory failure. A Corona virus victim, right in front of our eyes. The ambulance workers are guilty also. They know what is going on. When they arrive, the guy checked his pulse, with three cops on top of him(he was dead, from the police). An other Black man Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times by the police. The guy was casually walking, like he didn't know any thing was going on. That was caught on video also. To try to make Antifa BLM look like they are evil and deserving of this evil.  The police stage some killings, where they had a blue lives matter, aspiring German police officer aspirant from an other state, come to Kenosha and kill some people. There is video of the police thanking this group of men and boys(including the killer Kyle Rittenhouse) with semi automatic weapons for coming, and offering them some bottles of water. Kyle Rittenhouse (German kid) wearing the same latex blue gloves that police wear, when they are about to kill some one. Kyle killed a young man, phones some one, admitting, that he just killed some one, and this was caught on video, even though this heavily armed group had said, turn off all cameras, just before the shooting, which was also recorded on video. Kyle ran from there, down the street to were a group of about 5 police armoured vehicles were, but not before killing another person trying to stop him for killing the first person. He also blew a mans bicep half off by shooting him.(this is the kid that Trump says is a hero) After all this gun fire and killings Kyle Rittenhouse was able to walk by all the police vehicles, still carrying his semi automatic weapon, with people yelling to the police, that this guy shot all those people. Kyle left the State as he didn't even live in that State. He was a hired gun, by the government, to make you hate Antifa and BLM. If people had of listened to their order, to shut phones off, then Trump would have got away with it. He would have proved to you, that Antifa BLM are evil. So just like the Jews were made to look evil by the Catholic church, so are Blacks and those opposing the Church. Trump is pro Roman Church, as he appointed 6 Jesuit Judges to the Supreme Court. Jesuits are a militant arm of the Catholic Church, which say they will destroy enemies of the Church by any means possible. Trump is of German background, and his grand father, who was German, has the middle name Christian, which refers to the Roman Church. Trump's wife's last name is also German, which it was of course the Germans who started the greatest slaughter of human beings in recent times, but can not be compared to the slaughter of the Americas, by the Roman Empire, under Papal direction. By Trump appointing those Judges, which will work against the peoples' rights and freedoms, shows that he is not for you. Trump is a very wealthy man, and he is attacking those who are trying to make you free. The things they say are reversed. Every thing they say about China, is really about them. They say that China has concentration camps, but it is America. The MP of Kingston Ontario was cut off in the Ontario government's legislature, for asking about the concentration camps and what they will be used for. First he asked one question, that was side stepped around, and when he got no intelligent answer, asked another and was immediately shut down, by the guy on the throne. Black people are some what outside of the controls of the false church, and they see the hypocrisy of it, and the church can not stand that, as it needs absolute control, and that is why Black people and America is under attack, because the Pope has declared war on you.  There are many other Black people who have been killed by police, like the Black man who had a perforated bag put over his head, in New York State, and was pushed, with all of an officer's weight, in to the street, killing him, and another officer comforts the killer cop saying, it is not your fault.  The man never resisted, even until his death he didn't.  Another black woman was shot through her window, by a cop, while she played vide games with her nephew.  Both of these killings were on police body cam. There are many other killings that are recorded, and many that have not gotten recorded.  This is an attack by the Pope to undermine your entire system America.  The Pope controls many nations, as he is the King.(Vatican City State, which has its own flag...etc) The Pope has a triple tiered crown, which is on the Papal flag and has the number 666 on it. The 666 on the crown symbolizes his supposed position on earth. It is written in Latin. Doesn't the Bible say some thing about the number 666? In the book of Daniel in the Bible, we see that governments are reffered to as beasts. The Bible says, that those who worship the beast, or the image of the beast will be for ever condemned. The cross of the false church symbolizes its belief system, which includes a fake Sabbath, and many unBiblical beliefs. The Bible says, call no man your father on earth. Why do the Catholic Priests call themselves fathers? It is because the Bible says, that they are full of blasphemy, as there is only one father of us all, who is in heaven. There is no Pope mentioned in the Bible. The Pope claims to descend from Peter, and that is how he gets his power, but that is not supported by scripture. The Pope and his priests(Fathers) say, they are single, because the Apostle Peter was single. In the Bible it mentions Jesus(Yeshua) healing Peter's mother in law. You can't be single and have a mother in law. Peter had a mother in law, so he had to have a wife. The Roman Catholic system is satanic and a fraud. Some have come out of the false church, as God told them to, but they have gone in to a daughter religion, instead of the truth. Protestantism is also fake. Same fake Sabbath, called the Lord's day, so people will think it is the Biblical Sabbath. BLM is being made to look evil, so that when the full scale extermination happens, people will not feel sorry for them. Antifa apposes what God opposes, but is being made to look evil. Communism is mentioned in the Bible, it says, that the followers sold all their belongings, and had all things in common. The false church and state combination, always appose any thing that they can't control. Revelation/Apocalypse 18 of the Bible says, in her was found the blood of the prophets, holy ones and all those slaughtered from the earth. BLM are opposed to Black people being exterminated, as any one with a good conscience can see is happening. Antifa is being set up to look bad by the people who are trying to keep you enslaved. God gave the earth to the Adam and his offspring, which includes all mankind. The inhabitants of the earth, own the planet collectively. There are people pretending to represent God, who are stealing from you. Speaking of the false church and empire, the Bible says, that they came only but to kill, steal and destroy. Look at history and you will see! Antifa is not Fascism, but is directly in opposition, as its very name implies. Rome s waging war on America and the world. They have tried to kill me many times, and it will be worth it to me, as long as you copy, share and talk about what I wrote hear. God be with the peoples of the earth in their struggle for freedom!  *Amen	156

"Why is this so difficult for people to see... Biden and the Dems are the racists! Did you see that: ""No one's teaching that. You're a racist!"" Hilarious. Then offers no explanation, but an ad misericordiam argument. Sorry folks, this is all BIG SMOKE because the Dems--hate to enlighten you--think you're stupid and they know what's best. Biden knows damn-well that we all have the right to our own moral sentiments. You can't standardize non-prejudice. That's part of a local-cultural background. To offer explicit awareness training is purely policing ideology on the pretty side of the table (this time around). WAKE UP! They are causing the division! They don't benefit from racism or poverty falling. They'd have no votes. They bank on you being interested in short-term gains, and after 30 years when they don't deliver--oh, well, we'll put Pelosi or Hilary in a leather jacket and teach her another line of Spanish. See, the Dems play on these issues. Trump talks agenda and infrastructure. The left only gives you HATE SPEECH--like, ""he's a bad boy"" and other reactionary agendas. Idiots should have gone back to the drawing board, figured out what you actually stood for, and redefined the party and found new representation to deliver it. Instead, they wasted 4 years trying to lynch the winner! THIS IS a democracy! Don't vote if you can't accept the possibility of loss. We don't live in a monarchical society. It's one term. Chill the fu*^ OUT! And stop the loaded question about condemning white supremacy. That plays into their hand. Then they turn around and say, SEE, HE LEADS THEM. NO! He has no more reason to do so than Biden. I'd be insulted! I would neer address those low-rent assh(&&Y as the President. Shame on these liberals for commandeering real issues of social inequality for their own self-serving political gains. Seriously, when someone talks to you like you need a handout... ask what thefu*& these people are up to. You think Obama established healthcare penalties because he loves us or something...wake up! They'll be singing John Lennon songs while we approach 0% exports with 230% tax on the speculative possibility of exports--and the new silk road pulls out with every import we depend on... short term gains.  Liberals run the country like California runs its State!"	-1

Yeah go faster making a vaccine.  Let's not be careful on not making a mistake that could actually kill people. Let's not worry about making mistakes. Let's just throw chemicals as fast as we can into a tube and inject into people and hope it doesn't kill them or cause other health damages.  The faster you work on something the more likely it is for you to make a mistake. Keep that in mind.	-1

like a foreiginer i say Trump is better almost in everything . He created jobs, opportunity for people make a business especially for afroamerican and hispanic, the most of them in history  they study and have a job. Economy before coronavirus grow up. America is superpower again. Do you remember Obamas time, wars and USA losing respect and now how demecrats turn  everything to the chaos. Democrats supports  not peacefull demonstrations and looting. the economy will be in a terrible state again. today's democrats are socialists. they never did anything for afroamericans and hispanics, today they only have words. Okey corona.....  i dont agree with Trump, but the positives of his government far outweigh it. TRUMP is again a better solution for America and the world. don't be blind and remember the facts.	-1

"Second Amendment to the United States Constitution - ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Fundamentally what created our country was out ability as a people to rise against the government as they become tyrannical in nature.  ..  The Second Amendment IS the voice of the people, with no Second Amendment there is no First. Without even considering the empirical data, and self defense arguments which have merit of their own, it allows the people the option of non-compliance to Government which without, is forfeit. If you disagree with Government or Politics, the 2nd Amendment is the right of the PEOPLE. I may have been born in Korea, but I was raised American, Protect the FREE PEOPLE."	-1
...am I the only one who’s gonna speak as a duel citizen here? There is no covid19. it’s made up, and Doctors all over Europe are standing up for it and even the US.

Wtf is wrong with all of you in the Media and Biden... Even if trump was a liar I’m not saying he is or isn’t  ANYTHING is better than you whores for you filthy con-companies like big fucking pharma and the WHO and CDC	-1

On a serious note though, come on guys. Biden would be such a weak president, I can see him getting used by his people and be manipulated so much. Hes too soft, I'm not saying Trump is the great but at least he comes off strong and unmoved if pushed. I'll take a strong president who's a blabber mouth over a doormat who will do whatever their team tells them to do without having a free thought of his own to make decisions	-1

I love how Biden uses Trump knew and did nothing. When he tried the first time democrats blocked it. Trump had to go over the democrats and use his power to block China travel.  Biden is flat out lying and using what the democrats did to use against trump.  I remember watching this at the beginning of the year. People aren't stupid biden. Well some are uninformed. And believe Biden but a lot of people remember this.	338

President Trump has become a labor to Africa especially to  Ethiopia. The leader of  powerful nation, without sympathy to the poor nations.Our country Ethiopia strives to get out of poverty and feed her own people. Trump stands besides Egypt who benefit from Nile without limitation ignoring the source of the Nile.  He pends funds for our country,and suggests blowing of the only dam women hope to stop cooking with woods or students who study with lamp,  is it fair? May God give the judgement!!!  who says vengeance is mine. He may stop the fund from his treasury, World Bank or IMF, but he cannot close every window of blessing if God wants to bless our country. Our nation trusts in God very much in heart.  Let God give him long life, and see the country's progress he tried to smash ten years from now.... seating in his couch ....trying to change the channel... being pissed of by the news he  hears.	-1

Why is he not in home care? Whoever put him up to this is a fucking asshole trying to destroy america.  PS this is coming from someone who scored 132 IQ when I was 20. I don't trust biden's intelligence at all. Sorry, talk shit to me or about me, idgaf, biden is mentally unstable, my 97 grandpa has more coherence.	-1

"Trump promptly decided to suspend flights to China on January 31, 2020. At that time, there were only five cases of CCP VIRUS infection in the United States, all of which entered from CCP.  Trump was the first national leader to make the decision to cut air travel. At that time, other countries were afraid of offending CCP and dared not make this decision. Trump took the lead in the decision. The General Secretary of the World Health Organization Tedros also came out to criticize Trump and the Democratic Party of the United States.  The leaders of the party even came out to accuse Trump, the American leader  Streaming media followed awareness offensive, saying that Trump’s closure of CCP was “discrimination”, “xenophobia,” and “hysteria.” Trump insisted on cutting off CCP’s flights despite the huge domestic and international attacks and pressures.  More than half a month later, Europe was closed, showing superhuman courage, leadership, judgment and execution. This is Trump’s first accomplishment. Some clowns be wise after the event, accusing Trump of breaking the voyage to Europe late, causing  Many Chinese people poured into the United States from the big breach in Europe, which caused a major outbreak in the United States. After the United States blocked the CCP, Europe became the main entrance for CCP VIRUS to flow into the United States. However, at that time, there were a large number of Americans in Europe who wanted to return  The United States cannot help but let these Americans go home. Even if Trump forecasts that Europe is a big breach for the virus to enter the United States, he will hesitate whether he should close Europe's flights as soon as possible. Because, if Europe is cut off too soon  A large number of Americans have broken their way home, and the United States will not do such inhumane things.  Although Chuanquan took the action to seal the air, the bureaucracy CDC did not act. Its complicated tapes and unqualified test kits delayed the epidemic and delayed the fight against the epidemic.  This cannot be blamed on Trump. The CDC itself failed to develop a qualified test kit, but refused the quest to cooperation private companies to do it. CDC is a dog in the manger! The virus detection was delayed for four or five weeks.  On February 25, on the day when Trump returned from a three-day visit to India, he learned that the CDC was still delaying, so he held a press conference that night, appointing Vice President Pence as the anti-epidemic commander, and devolving the CDC's power to develop and produce test kits.  Specific private companies have abolished the cumbersome rules set by Obama to detect the epidemic, and delegated the CDC's testing power to hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.  Subsequently, Trump ordered many manufacturers to switch production, immediately manufacture masks and ventilators, and contact and meet with various manufacturers to discuss specific matters about the production of masks and ventilators, and met with manufacturers in the White House to listen to production reports.  Trump also held daily press conferences to inform the public about the situation.  Under Trump's leadership, the kits were quickly produced and continuously improved and innovated. Soon a large area of ​​timely, rapid and accurate testing began.  This is Trump's second achievement.  Trump took immediate assistance to the states, distributed medical supplies such as ventilators and masks to states in proportion to the severity of the epidemic, and personally contacted and organized the dispatch of medical ships to New York and California.  This is Trump's third contribution.  According to the CDC report ""Weekly Updates by Select Demographic and Geographic Characteristics"", from February 1, 2020 to October 15, 2020, for more than ten months, the total number of deaths caused by the virus in China was 204,000.  However, the total number of deaths in the United States during the same period was 2.22 million, 200,000  It accounts for 9% of the total deaths.  The United States has a population of more than 300 million people, and the normal average number of deaths throughout the year is about 2.8 million.  Taking CDC's 2017 data as an example, the annual mortality rate in the United States is 8.64%, and the total death toll is 2.81 million.  Among them, there were 647,000 deaths from heart disease, 600,000 deaths from cancer, 160,000 deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases, 146,000 deaths from stroke, 120,000 deaths from Alzheimer’s, 83,000 deaths from diabetes, 56,000 deaths from lung diseases, and 50,000 deaths from kidney diseases.  There were 170,000 accidents and 470,000 suicide deaths.  Under Trump’s leadership, the death rate of the highly contagious CCP virus was maintained at 9%, which is the average death rate in the United States. This death rate is based on the high popularity and high detection rate of Trump’s efforts to promote testing.  It has no concealment of the precise number below.  This is Trump's fourth achievement.  Most importantly, of the 200,000 deaths from CCP VIRUS, which accounted for only 9%, 90% were elderly people with underlying diseases. For these elderly people, the Wuhan virus was an opportunity to cause them to die from complications.  In several speeches, Trump emphasized the need to protect the elderly, and recently organized a meeting to protect the elderly.  Under Trump's advocacy, promotion, and leadership, the elderly in the United States have received more favorable and better protection.  This is Trump's fifth achievement.  Those leftists who are brain-disabled keep talking about 200,000 and use this single number to scare people without mentioning the death rate. The purpose is to prevent the opening of schools and businesses and prevent the United States from opening up and developing the economy.  They never mentioned the Obama era. During the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, the Obama administration took six months to declare a national emergency. From April 2009 to April 2010, the number of deaths reached 30 in just one year.  Million, it is reported that this number is also greatly underestimated.  During this period, Obama did not act at all, and even the WHO adopted an attitude of giving up fighting the epidemic.  At the end of November 2009, more than 7 months after the first case appeared, the WHO completely abandoned the counting of confirmed cases after recording 620,000 confirmed cases and close to 8,000 deaths.  Obama has never taken concrete actions as aggressively as Trump, only sleeping four or five hours a day to fight the epidemic.  Moreover, the Chinese coronavirus that Trump is facing is much more infectious and lethal than the H1N1 flu virus that Obama faced in 2009. If it weren't for Trump's dedication to lead the anti-epidemic attitude.  At the end of November 2009, more than 7 months after the first case appeared, the WHO completely abandoned the counting of confirmed cases after recording 620,000 confirmed cases and close to 8,000 deaths.  Obama has never taken concrete actions as aggressively as Trump, only sleeping four or five hours a day to fight the epidemic.  The CCP VIRUS that Trump faced was much more contagious and lethal than the H1N1 flu virus that Obama faced in 2009. If it were not for Trump’s dedication to lead the fight against the epidemic, CCP VIRUS would kill more than ten times more people.  200,000.  Obama has been in power for eight years, and the Republican Party has never Sow discord. & incite disharmony for his inaction.  However, the Democratic Party has been criticizing Trump for Conscientious and Great achievements!  What's more, they have framed up and investigated impeachment!  What is even more intolerable is that when the epidemic came and Trump tried his best to lead the fight against the epidemic, the Democratic Party was still impeaching him non-stop!  Since Trump took office, the Democratic Party has focused on framing Trump!  At any cost!  It finally aroused public outrage, and the people saw clearly that Trump was Exhausted for the country and the people, the Democratic Party was despicable and shameless, Deceive too much!  Not to mention that the mutation and degeneration of the Democratic Party and its mainstream media have reached the point where they can no longer be added, and they have been reduced to a gang that does everything they can.  The public also sees clearly that the Democratic presidential candidate Biden has been mixed in politics for 47 years and has become extremely corrupt. He has collaborated in evildoing with the CCP and destroyed and betrayed the United States.  Now, it's finally time to investigate him!  This is a juncture in history, and when will it be better!"	146

The President Trump is a very enthusiastic man to fight for the US and for its people, it is so hard to listen to the lies knowing who you mr. biden (small letters) serve, may GOD bless and save America and the world if your bosses win, the biggest, maybe the worst ever war could destroy the world and humanity if you win. The stealing, the greed, the arrogance and the total negligence of humanity's survival is your agenda vice president now. Maybe the holes in the mountains created to save you guys, won't work, you and your bosses have to wake up from greed, no matter how delusional all of you are.	-1

Servants of the darkest side of the history of humanity ever.

The call of Bahá’u’lláh (The promised one of all ages) is primarily directed against all forms of provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If long-cherished ideals and time-honored institutions, if certain social assumptions and religious formulae have ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind, if they no longer minister to the needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the immutable law of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration that must needs overtake every human institution? For legal standards, political and economic theories are solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any particular law or doctrine.             ~ Shoghi Effendi ~	-1

Having public healthcare is not the end of private healthcare. I hear so many Americans against public healthcare and I'm amazed at how moronic they are. What's the damn problem with having a public healthcare system? I can pay for healthcare insurance and go to private hospital if I choose, but I haven't had any problems using the public healthcare system here where I live, in fact my whole family all use public healthcare, some of which have had major heart surgery. If I lived in the US my monthly prescription for meds would cost me over $100, but here all pay is under $10 a month. I guess public healthcare really sucks hahaha	-1

Biden is so full of paradoxes.  He is going to solve global warming  within the next decade, and yet according to Kamala Harris, they stand  against AOC's Green New Deal.  He would've prevented the economy from  failing in 2020, and yet he would've been more aggressive in the  pandemic quarantine measures.  He claims to be against locking up drug  users, and yet his VP Kamala Harris was incredibly aggressive in locking  up marijuana users during her term as California Attorney General.  He  just employs magical thinking.  So many of his actions or proposals are  directly contrary to what he says will happen under his administration!	-1

Elon Musk is digging tunnels underneath cities for the same reason they sent all the rockets into space, but you don't know why do you? PLEASE READ VERY CAREFULLY  Armageddon's 4 Horses are the BOW, SWORD, SCALES & FIRE = Send it, Strike it, Split it & Sear it.  <--- THOSE ARE 4 ACTION EVENTS.   They started LAST YEAR. Yes, the 1st Horseman Started last year! Our planet SENT (Bow=SEND it) over 300 Rockets into Space since last year and each DAY we send a average of 3.23 MORE! Go inquire at the Observatories as to why ALL the Telescopes on this planet are CURRENTLY pointing to the WEST! A ROCK/Wormwood is COMING and That's what all those Rockets are for and no one is telling anyone about it! Those Rockets are WEAPONS! When they STRIKE (2nd Horseman Sword= STRIKE it), that Rock, it will SPLIT (3rd Horseman= Scales = SPLIT it) and a SPLIT piece of it will hit Our Planet, that is the 4th Horseman of Armageddon, the FIRE = SEAR it. Wake up WORLD!! Armageddon is upon Us. WATCH to the WEST for it will hit the Pacific Ocean and it will rock up and down the Pacific FIRE RING and it will send lava to the Skies when it does. It will rain fire over 2/3rd's of this planet! If you live anywhere near the Pacific, you need to move now! Move BEFORE they STOP sending the Rockets up, that's when you'll know they are ready and waiting on the rock to get here. Please come see my Armageddon video and make sure you read all my comments! Please, I'm begging you with all my heart and soul to listen to me. https://youtu.be/1UGpXddwv8I	-1

Years-long impeachment against Trump’s Russian collusion was based on a frame up from Hilary Clinton, according to the report, to protect her and Biden from corruption scandals!  Go, President Trump, to drain the political swamp! Here is no justice in this country unless Mr. Biden's long-time collusion is brought out to be accounted for in public for justice.	-1

"I've seen a lot of trump supporters comments and most of them are just bullshitting, mindlessly supporting, talking shit about Obama or anyone competing using very harsh words. You will not see ""civilised"" in trump supporters. It's all ignorance, arrogance and clueless people. Whenever you talk shit about someone, give facts. Otherwise you'll just make a fool out of yourself by writing such low class comments."	-1
I would like to elect Chris Wallace as president of the world. Just look at him defeating both candidates with logic and sense.	-1
This whole coronavirus thing was the work of the Democrats trying to sabotage all the good work that the president accomplish for America. We all know the Democrats want to take over and have control over everyone. Joe Biden is standing up there accusing the president pretty much of this whole coronavirus outbreak when he knows good and well that this was all intentional on all a part of the plot to destroy America..	-1
Donal Trump cannot debate. He's like a child who will cut you off in the middle of your turn to speak and changes the subject to an issue that is irrelevant to the question at hand. He is so transparent in his inabilities I actually felt embarrassed as an American that he is our President. There is so much more that I feel compelled to say, but that would take up too much of my time to say. Besides, anyone who watched this debate will see the same things I've seen.	-1

(To Western Society) … I sent the attached file: ( The earth belongs to Allah ) This Is The Link :  ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OELmaJqTOuq4it-dmakqhsgzcT9qqIgR/view?usp=sharing ) to many idolatry temples in the world via the regular mail and online , and I will keep sending it and urging the real believers in Allah to send it until Allah concludes a predetermined matter, but before you read it I would like to talk to you… the politicians ( policymakers ) in Western society and in the same time to all people in Western society through this message , My words with you will be a four questions I will ask you and I will answer them on your behalf.  My first question is: Are you against violence and hatred speech and the factors and motives that incite violence and hatred?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!!  My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!!  My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!! My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!   Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated.  Now listen carefully what I am going to say ….. Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!. The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences. The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere.  Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God's existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !!  Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator.  No one can understand the God's Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic.  God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do ))………………………………….  Mazen Alargha	-1

In few points each one has a little idea how making things work. Lacking of ideas, disqualifications and sarcastic smiles show me that even noone deserves to be an USA president, one of this two average man will. Time for serious or inteligent debates has gone by. Now we have what the time has pushed us to have: Two clowns fighting as humans trying to get a seat to run a country. If only they knew what it takes. And Trump is already sitted there !	-1

40. God is He who created you, then provides for you, then makes you die, then brings you back to life. Can any of your idols do any of that? Glorified is He, and Exalted above what they associate.  41. Corruption has appeared on land and sea, because of what people’s hands have earned, in order to make them taste some of what they have done, so that they might return.  42. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe the fate of those who came before. Most of them were idolaters.”  43. So devote yourself to the upright religion, before there comes from God a Day that cannot be averted. On that Day, they will be shocked.  44. Whoever disbelieves, upon him falls his disbelief. And whoever acts righteously—they are preparing for themselves.  45. So that He may reward those who have believed and done the righteous deeds out of His bounty. Indeed, He does not love the ungrateful.  46. And of His signs is that He sends the winds bearing good news, to give you a taste of His mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His command, and so that you may seek of His bounty, and so that you may give thanks. Chapter 30, The Romans	-1

"The lack of critical thinking in the comments section and America in general is very scary to me. I've grown up here all my life and all I ever see are people regurgitating misinformation and hate that they are fed by prominent figures/organizations such as CNN and Fox news. It seems as though people can't understand that no matter which side you're on Democrat or Republican, we vote because we believe that it's best for the country, not because of some radicalized ideals that people accentuate. And don't give me crap by saying, ""But the Democrats/radical left"" or ""But the Republicans/Trump cult."" That kind of talk only creates division and hate."	-1

It wasn't a debate..they just actually exposed what they been doing to us people.. especially people of color....they are wiping us off this planet anyway possible but keep us entertained with the played out social media...etc.. we need to fight back...these people don't run our lives...we have our own lives...bill gates said he could get the population to zero and that's what's happening now and Trump just wants to contribute to that ...our doom is here...we have to come together and take this world into our own hands and make it a better place...these evil people dont like humanity and is only a problem to us	-1

Biden talking directly to the camera in order to establish some sort of faux-connection with the audience shows you exactly why noone should vote for such a dinosaur who hails from an era of politics that is dead and gone for a reason. He is soulless and utterly out of touch. I hope America votes with their heads. I wish you all the best, regardless how you vote.	-1

To blame the corona virus deaths on  Trump is nonsense, and a waste of time.      Google this:  Mexico Finally Recognize Its Black Citizens, But That's Just the Beginning.        They just recognized their black citizens this year 2020.   Talking about racist people!	-1

He has fixed it he has made medical better wow	-1
Donald Trump says he is doing a project called the billion trees project. First of all that will probably take years for them to do that since they cant focus for one second, also 15 billion trees are cut down every year! How does that make much of a difference? Next time they bring up a project, do something with a bit more effort so that the young generation doesn't suffer from the older people mistakes	-1

Trump lies in 2nd debate :  1.) Covid vaccine in weeks. When asked to guaranty he blackout 😊 2.) Paying tax in tens of millions but do not file tax since four years. He said same thing during first election. 3.) Evaded question on separating 500 childrens to asking who built jails instead of answering why they separated. Building jails is not bad but making inhuman decisions is crime as Biden said. 4.) He knew in January how severe this decease is but said it will vanish soon because it will effect his business.  5.) He is racist and has done nothing to black community. We'll know what he thinks about all communities except white people and mind you only RICH WHITE.  6.) HE insulted other countries calling Russia, China, India as filthy but when he was in India he said India is great, nice and love India.... He is two faced.  7.) Trump is tuff only to countries like Iran, Syria, Palestine which are poor, helpless, and military is not strong. North Korea violated all their promises but he did not put sanctions.  8.) When asked about NKorea he said Kim is friendly with him but what about his breaches? Iran does nothing but he orders to kill their Generals.   Trump on 1st presidential election podium said he evades tax... That's enough for Americans tax department to put him behind bars let alone context for presidency. If he gets elected Americans are most niave people.	-1

Trump wins because he cares about economy and much more realistic with numbers. Biden is talking too much... Obama care was a disaster, jobs were at risk, companies were going abroad etc. Trump won last election because people wanted a change, but with Biden all will get back to old school business. I don't think it's a right candidate against Trump, it has to be better than that...	-1

Seriously, debating about health insurance? Are you kidding me? Basics are 1. roof over your head 2. enough to eat 3. health insurance. What a bloody f...up! Health insurance should be FREE then maybe just maybe the Food Industry will be forced to produce less sick-making products. And maybe just maybe the Media will be forced to publish less sick-making information. This is all such a sham just another diversion. Taxes are paid to guaranty a BETTER LIFE and certainly not to pay for WARS and other interests which do not directly concern the taxpaying population. BLOODY WOLVES IN SHEEP CLOTHING, ALL OF THEM!	-1
This is a plandemic. Everything that is happening right now such as the Corona Virus has been planned by the Elites, the billionaires and millionaires such as bill gates and much more, which are Satan worshippers. who run this world. They want to create a new world order out of chaos. They want to reduce the world population. It is on the United Nations Agenda 21, the Georgia Guidestones, and even on the one dollar bill. They had all of this planned out before it even happened. They want to have a digital currency where they implant mandatory chips into people. Through this chip they will be able to alter your dna sequence, they will be able to control you. You will lose your God-given Freedoms to live free on this earth. you will no longer be human. They want to create a one-world currency, and a one-world government out of chaos. And for this to happen they want to crash the current economy and dollar, and they want to create chaos, in order to control us.  Please Do Not Take The Corona Virus Vaccine that is Coming. I pray that the American people and people all over the world. wake up. Wake Up. If you know the ingredients inside that vaccine which  will come with a chip, you will never want that to enter your Body. as a human being. Forgive me if I offend you. I want people to wake up Wake up. I thank you for reading this comment Through. God Bless You in Yeshua(Jesus) Name.	-1

"As they use the button to cut Trump off , I only read about Hilter style news agenda , but We are seeing it First Hand, Joe Biden is the guy who gave most American jobs to China in 2001, he has promised China that he would stop all Tariffs to China, and threw his Green plan that all contracts would go to China not American companies.  In Plan Site look at the three red lines in Biden signs,  Three Red Banners (Chinese: 三面红旗) was an ideological slogan in the late 1950s which called on the Chinese people to build a socialist state. The ""Three Red Banners"" also called the ""Three Red Flags,"" consisted of the General Line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes.[1][2][3]"	-1

I am starting to really see that everything on TV is staged so whats real anymore? Just think for decade's upon decades TV has been scripted for viewers and the more false reality people tune into the more they generally become what they see on it and the actions towards it. If someone who never seen TV and how emotions or thoughts or actions have been betrayed during situations it will be totally a different reaction. (aside from people in your life who do watch TV)I guess i am trying to say its like dressed in fully upscale brand name clothing but your jewlery is fake a little of real with fake!	-1

Honestly Think about it nothing in this country truly make sense when it comes to the laws of the land For instance How we vote in this country makes no sense So the popular vote is the peoples vote  But the people's vote is not used to pick the president the electoral college picks the president meaning the senators that the people voted into power to be in this  The senate speaking for them on their behalf Isn't really speaking on their behalf If the popular vote for president can be outweighed by the electoral college vote When the senators in the electoral college or supposed Place their voteBy the standards of their extensions Meaning by the standards of the people that voter for them in their States But what's going on is this if the president that the people pics and that state is not the one that the senator of the state once the senator of the state is not going to put the people's choice on their ballot there going to put their choice on their ballot and that's the reason why Hillary Clinton was not president because the people voted her to be president but the electoral college did know fuck the people This country is built and made for the people by the people So technicallyThe older women in the older man we have in the senate has been there for 60 years or basely pissing and shitting on the corpse of or forefathers because this is not what our fore fathers saying for America at all Basically was going on is a bunch of white men fighting in bigger because a group of them once everyone in this country to be looked at as equal human beings see that's the problemThe Declaration of Independence And the Constitution was written black people workers city as animals we were not considered human meaning animals do not have rights to themselves nor land This is truly with their ordering over The Empire meant of the black society within America A lot of caucasians in America is scaredOf the black ecosystem within America becoming strong enough To support black people as a whole in America meaning Blacks in caucasians Being equal yet severed And what that will do to the Caucasian ecosystem Is take wealth from it That is one thing that caucasians love more than life property and money This is why this country is how it is Fossil fuel is exactly what it sounds like fossil fuel it is not plentifulIf people were to really do their research on what fossil fuel truly is they will understand that it is not something that will be here for everlasting But as long as we take care of this planet will forever have solar energy When to run turbines And even now companies like Tesla run their course of a battery And do not need fossil fuel at all And drives Just As fast End aS for of the  So  distance So what is the real reason why degree new bill having been passed and probably won't be passed	-1

Let's talk about the homeless we've been owing For the past 4 months that this virus is airborne But we are doing nothing to get the homeless off the street the people Super spreaders For the simple fact they no longer have a place to go on wash their hands for free They can't clean their bodies on a regular Yet alone afford a mass to wear on their face But we say that we are trying to get rid The Corona Virus ...🤔 To me a  It seems like all talk Like majority of the things that go on in the United States of America All Talk No action Unless it is beneficial to the party that is doing the talking meaning in this case white Suburban America Every time a law is passed in this country the main group of people that benefit from the law is the same people that are against the law that they benefit From For example Suburban America Want to cancel Obama care and welfare But majority of people that are on Obama care and welfare or Caucasian Americans So basically to hurt the few They are willing to compose their own	-1

And when you speak on the state's being closed down in a high divorce rate that's because majority of these people that are getting married to each other should never have been married to each other if they can't spend more than 4 hours around each other we work 8 hours A-day come home  For 4 hours go to sleep and wake up to work another 8 hours We in America not Work to live we live to work And if you can't spend a week around your spouse without ordering with your spouse over frivolous things It was never love they were married for stability not love when the stability of that Union is jeopardised That you enough stability breaks down there is no love and that form of Union So honestly if Joe Biden was the set this country down in pay people to sit in the house for let's say 4 months straight but literally pay people to wear their lively expenses can still be Taking care of Maybe there wouldn't be so many divorces Maybe they wouldn't So many foreclose houses Maybe there wouldn't be so many Small businesses shutting down And I find it funny have majority of the small businesses that are being shut down or on by people of colour meaning blacks hispanics or Chinese  And everyone is turning a blind I To the fact how many McDonald's has closed down How many targets has shut down Walmart Grocery stores If you were a multibillion near at the beginning of the pandemic you are basically a billionaire now So meaning if you are a chainOf different Splinter sales of your company you received a hell of a bailout during the Corona  And look at it how New homeless people have this virus created	-1

Understand this if Donald Trump  Get a second   Term of presidency Where going to war with China so please please make your decisions wisely because if your not ready to go to war with China you wouldn't want to vote for Donald J trump And the reason I believe that is because the way he justifies the oil companies like we are not living in the year 2020Like fossil fuel is the only fuel that we use to create electricity or drive or Vehicles No fossil fuelMainly makes it's money off a the suffering of other people's backs meaning war	-1

"There is no right or left; they are two wings on the same bird. Donald Trump's son in law (one of his advisors) is a Democrat.  I wouldn't vote for either of them; although the President is a SELECTED puppet anyway.   The debates aren't even good entertainment; pathetic both are fighting over (playing their role)  what they *know* is a plannedemic scamdemic:  https://www.bitchute.com/video/sB3fC0FR0iBG/  Dr. Anthony Fauci stated in the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" that C-19 was INFLUENZA (the seasonal flu).

I have to say . Just by how Trump talks he's a real person . Joe seems so fake and doesn't have the factual voice I'm looking for . Now on the other hand .

Please please please close your eyes and just listen to the conversation, without seeing their expressions or anything, just listen to their voices and how they speak, at almost any time in this debate, you can hear which sounds like a fool and immature, and you can hear which one actually sounds like a president. Even though no one deserves the presidency, just listen to them and nothing more, which is the BEST choice for ALL, not just for yourself.	-1
"They are both not the right person for this, but getting Trump out should be our first concern. I was going to rant on our current ""leader"" but im realizing more and more, that the majority of people in our country are effing idiots and im preparing for 4 more years of this shit. 4 more years of turning on my favorite programs only to watch what the trumps did today.  And , get this, 4 full terms of the cunt we gave now..."	-1

Just 2 facts-Trump separated children from their parents and now can’t find over 500 parents——do you know how much mental rehabilitation these innocent kids will need? 2.

WARNING: This is my opinion, and I’m not disrespecting anyone’s political views because we all have our reasons for who we support and all have different lives. But watching this debate, I can see how Biden often deflects from actually answering the question and tries to pull us Americans in emotionally in a manipulative way, which is not something I want in a president. He tries to demonize President Trump for shutting down the economy because of COVID-19 when he would have no idea how to handle it himself. In fact, he would make the economy worse if he were elected because he wants to keep ObamaCare which is super expensive and is promising “free” things that aren’t really free and are paid by giving everyone ridiculously high taxes (except for him and the rich people). Also, he wants to talk about women’s rights yet is okay with a child being murdered because it should be a woman’s “choice.” Why doesn’t the baby get a choice? It’s the baby’s life being taken from them. I understand that sometimes there are terrible circumstances and a woman is scared to have the child, but it’s still MURDER. If you killed someone you saw on the street, you would go to jail for life for it, but if you kill a growing baby, heartless people celebrate your “right” to choose instead of admitting that it’s murder no matter what pregnancy term the mother was in or the circumstances of the pregnancy. I won’t vote for a liar, manipulator, and advocate for murder. President Trump supports pro-life, lower taxes than what Biden would cause, a healthcare that would be better than Obamacare, the military, and family values. Don’t buy into the lies of men like Biden just because he gets good press. Instead of relying on what the media tells you, think for yourself and do your research. President Trump is gonna win this election and continue to make America great again. And even if you hate me or disagree with me for all that I just said, I respect your political views even if they’re different than mine. Because we’re all human beings at the end of the day just trying to make our country better. God Bless You🙏🏻	-1
The 200000 people that died, how many of them survived p? Well....	62
Trump wouldn't let Biden talk both and good point of views but Covid Healthcare jobless hit different when you at minimum wage and last racism is big Biden said let work together as one and I totally agree 👏	-1

Anybody just jumping from the second debate for this one to have fun?	-1
Both candidates may not be the best choice but out of the two Trump is the best choice. He's built us a wall, he tells us things other presidents keep away from us,  he let us know about fake news,  he tells us about the media's lies, he gave us stimulus, he gives his entire check back to the treasury,  and there's many more.  Biden and his family are corrupt.  Biden wants to take our second amendment right what he calls assault weapons which is all weapons away from us.  He'll flood the supreme Court and try to change the Constitution. He touches and smells little kids. He's also a Democrat that should be enough.  Vote TRUMP 2020 people.	-1

Dosent President trump donated his presidency check, wow so generous to the needy but scams taxs. I don't take it for what they want us to take it. I understand completely Biden dosent even try to be serious about anything and it could be possible President trump has a gift of can. Biden definitely could not have the gift of gab sense he just uses his name and connections to not get what he wants cus he can only be used as a puppet by his own family if he didn't talk to his son and son business.    that means his son just went and used his father for personal gain no matter the outcome for Biden in yet Biden is covering up for son and defending his son just so son can think of ya I can be f up and get away with it. used himagain his own son	-1
Kudos and props to Kristen! She was so professional.	-1

Cus if he was elected,what gonna be said,(WELL NOW THAT HE'S GONE LET TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT REALLY GOING TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS.)	-1

Joe is a leeach and been in office for 50 years and has the worst record ever. God bless Trump, I voted for Trump.

Why Trump has mentioned China so many times? He is the leader of US! He has to take the full responsibility  no matter what happens! Honestly,he hasn't done anything good except talking shit! You can see China has done pretty well to stop covid19 spreading inside the country. What about Trump? He's just blaming China and other countries that he doesn't like? What's wrong with him? It's not healthy to split the people in 2 groups! So many conflicts and hates! We should focus on our lives! Not on this stupid politicians and elections! No matter what promises by those politicians, their purpose is only for the power and money. Do you really think they really care about you poor people? All about money and power! It will never ends! It's a circle.	-1
They’re all corrupt but Trump is the most unwell person I’ve ever seen. Narcissistic personality disorder at it’s finest. 👍🏻 😑 Is this real life? Like I’m asking a legitimate question...are they robots or are they real people?	-1

This is the Most Important post you will ever read;      Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC	-1

Easy solution to the interrupting of each other. Just shut off the mic when one person is speaking and the other is suppose to be listening. Seriously why do they not do this? What kind of fucking debate is this. The interrupting and talking over is pathetic and just shows how childish a person is.	-1

EVERY AMERICAN CAN VERIFY THIS.  very simple to see who is lying to you: Go get your 2015 tax return (tax law under Obama and JOE BIDEN) . Go get your 2018 tax return (Tax law under trump).   Obama and JOE BIDEN (left existing tax law NO REFORM) only allow $12,400 of standard deduction for married file jointly.  Trump REFORM Tax cut to allow $24,000 deduction for married file jointly.   less deduction means more taxes you pay.  You pay less taxes under Trump Admin	-1

"My thoughts on the debate. Trump made a nice comment putting fault on neither of the pandemic, however if Trump wants to play golf one day after week he should be able to, I like the low shade regarding Joe biden's son issues that was vicious, 99% but I understand I was in the slow class in math too(4real it was about 10 and I still graduated from college), Trump opening schools regardless if the school has active Covid..yikes, Liked Walk and Chew Gum, Loved Trump's Facial expressions hopefully it will be used on Tik Tok some how,  true what Trump stated about New York but the country is living in a time where people Do not have the money to waste on Gucci belts, Comparing Dr. Fauci to making a mistake verse the President making a mistake for his country, Loved Trump saying he got People in Wall Street to show his Clout, liked the woman of color hosting, her lashes and talking to Trump like a Junior High Teacher for him to focus,, loved the explanation of Sovereignty, loved the Orange glow but his hands don't match his face, Bob Barker 1st Cousin, Top Crip Representative and Top Blood Rep with an OG gangsta lean, love to watch rich people argue about poor people, I said ""You Do"" and was mad he didn't say it again, How THE HELL DO U PREPAY TAXES cus I'll prepay $20 and keep it moving.. damn White Privilege..lmao..,  too shady Trump Talking trash about his Brothers, loved the Flip Flop Trump talking trash on China but said he thought about working with them..lol.., Loved hearing White People say Malarchy, Trump saying Typical Politician but he is a politician, his love for the people of Seoul, Biden said Trump got thugs for friends lol, Confused on ""I could have gone the other route and everyone would have been unhappy"", felt like Trump was staring directly at me (wtf was the other route. NEW World Order?), Melania looking like a nija because she is mersible, Loved Biden's smooth pimp daddy laugh, Trump low flirt with the host, damn he ain't even from Scranton, Alabama is Different from NY??? Maybe fashion but we all need to survive..damn, OMG People coming over on Coyotes instead big saying Donkeys, Who built the cages? Damn. Cages!!, The enlarged eyes Of Trump when Biden talked about freeing those immigrant children, A rapist is a very bad person too as Trump could not think of another Option, Perry Mason shout out, Lowest IQ can come back to the country, 500 kids not knowing where their parents are and said  Good?!?!?! As a DCPP investigator And have worked with DV victims from their Husbands who beat them and tell them they can't call the police because they are illegal and the children have to witness this every day and night..not cool, Trump said he Helped Two Black people with loans....lol..""I'm the least racist""?!?!?lmao.. means you have racism thoughts and possibly ways..and to honest WE ARE ALL RACIST ON THE LOW..but when you have to leave your feelings at home and put on a fake ass smile in the world...Why not say He is not racist, because it wouldn't be realistic for anyone.  Wow someone calls u a racist and your mad about Abraham Lincoln comment.. lmao,  Loved Trump saying ""These Politicians, ALL TALK NO ACTION WAS THE BEST, Trump confusing Vice President Biden position from President Obama running the country, AND I MISSED THE EAGLES GAME. Pissed"	-1

"I can't comment on live one tonight, so I came here. I can't believe how the moderator in this last one is so bias and interrupting Trump. Biden refuses to answer questions, and she let's him speak all he wants. To all Democrats: Look at facts, watch more news than your fake ""news"". Hell, most of you never hear anything Trump actually does. Do your research... Biden is a racist..""Poor kids are just as talented and smart as white kids""..""super predator""...Joe Biden quotes. He so racist, even Kamala Harris hated him, but I guess she is the presidential candidate. Ignorance and hate is what the left is."	-1
Anyone over the age of 50 Knows when you raise the minimum wage ....everything goes up in price . He knows better eg gas would be at least 5$ / gal . milk , bread everything is going to skyrocket in price .Biden Knows this is true .He tries to convince  younger voters ,he's doing something for them . its totally falsifying the reality of the situation . also he is misrepresenting the TRUTH of what the O Bama administration did on immigration . in his heart , he knows the truth but he's counting on young voters to not be able to figure it out .	-1
"Ready for the SHOW....where both are relying on the key word 'IF"" but citizens need an ""I will"" a ""now"" !!! Neither need to be on a ""presidental  chair"" to ACT! THEY both can exercise the power of authority LEADING AND NOT playing "" he said"" "" he said"" ....enough is enough"	-1
In the second debate they said they would mute their mics to prevent interruption, i think a taser would work better.	-1

Trump kicked Bidens ass. I just wish I could have seen blood.	-1
Covid: well democrats knew about this last year, how come they didn’t warn anybody? Hmmm maybe because they were too busy trying to get trump impeached and they lost so let’s see January the year for elections and now all of sudden this virus came about, coincidence I think not. All of sudden riots racism, liberals think we the people are so stupid. This is all happening because they are trying to make trump look bad and blaming him for all this. Dems need to give it up. H1N1 killed double in amount then covid.	-1
Ahhh yes....... one of the most controversial comment sections there will ever be 😂	-1

When did the role of president of the United States become less about the good of the people, and more about the good of a party? Neither of these guys are going to bring this country together, they're going to tear it apart.	-1
This is true comedy	-1

We are all doomed. Trump is a child, and Biden is in love with money. We truly are in the worst timeline.	-1
The marshmallow at the end of the stick - the most anyone needs to live life independently and retire, $100,000 a year - is the democratic figure, by which the majority of people who say it's a terrible time to be black, as the 538 website reports, or something else that bad, would politically benefit from a cap on incomes of those who provide services would live in a world where the major commercial developments, of space for instance, could be publicly owned.  And that way other industries such as the media would be more easily regulated rather than serve as personal platforms for utter destructiveness to individuals.  But there's a hitch:  that is not a permanent likelihood ever for a shifting back and forth politics;  now that the far left communists have been shut out and effectively erased by the media, as anything on behalf of those who would have unified the world for that common goal of respects, including the moral ones to empower moderately well-off individuals (straight white and middle income along with the whole slew of other factors) of ways to advance/provide/develop environments of global inter-connected interests.  The way in which torture developed as a common bargaining right and offer/option in all forms of everyone's lifestyle and it definitely did and skyrocketed as such, for people who believe in animals and their lives/rights, wasn't necessary - that's what frames anyone so brutalist to still be unwittingly servicing the whole enterprise of greatly evil personal projection.  None of it was at all good or necessary except in the common democracy purely and absolutely for men only, and that is fundamentally so, with a period.  It completely has zero grace of women.  Only the servicing of the same old right-wing swathe of mentalities creating a foundation of abuse and demands for hidden horror contains their same rising desire into sins unable to be matched by what's lost in that decision to wipe out the democratic class chance as more sophisticated than the opposite to the first mentioned point;  the greed to acquire, acquire, acquire, and make sense, of the simple right of the rule of cash as law.  It isn't moral, and wickedly over-moralized the concept of freedom as the least possible not just probable of a higher capacity so to have that human part of the lasting character over and with as part of the world.  That points out that we are as part of our environment possibly affecting our inclinations democratic as such and not just nature, which goes farther and that does guide some individuals even up to the level of science in some completeness, which exaggerates oftentimes its claim, as a philosophy, of the mechanics of reason to it purely;  but that can be confused, and there is some simple humanity and freedom within its limits, and not just in ways a new, holistic but demanding culture is raising perhaps the majority of liberals in a state more unfamiliar as humane to some escapees such as hippies and their sense of freedom, and the role of the limited focus otherwise of love as eternal.  Be kind.  Torture is not kind.  That proliferated over the last decade.  That was a moral evil, that didn't always retreat or retract.	-1

This was awful for both parties.	-1
With the revelation on the Chinese energy firm, we have direct evidence (the smoking gun) that Hunter and Joe Biden were both involved in Hunter's personal money-making ventures from political connections. There is no way around this. The Democrats and the Media are backing a corruption filled dynasty, and they will continue to do so while blatantly denying the sun shines. Why? I said before, it has nothing to do with Trump or Biden, everything to do with a global socialist agenda. The vicious lies and attacks from the Democratic Left has to be put down or America is asking for its own demise. Is sacrificing America and it's freedoms worth the hatred of a single individual?	-1
2:32:05....when your crush have a bf and she ask u about having crush ?	-1

"How much taxes did you report? Joe Biden  ""I’ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I’ve seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn’t just Hunter’s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line,"" Bobulinski said.  ""The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist-controlled China,"" he added.  Bobulinksi also said that he believes that the Chinese involvement in the deal was ""political or influence investment"" on their part, and that ""Hunter wanted to use the company as his personal piggy bank by just taking money out of it as soon as it came from the Chinese."""	-1

It's simple people Joe brings nothing different to the table then what Hilary Clinton had to offer our country. Our country is weak under Democrats, we give give give but we Americans never win.

Well look at that. More avoiding of answers, and more attacking for a position of power. If you think about every person in America while you watch these guys go back and forth, you start to think about how much of a waste of time this all is. I mean how much work are either of these guys really going to put into the country?	-1

The way how trump interrupts the other dudes shows how eager he is	-1
Both sides are not the one no no nope im not voting this year thank god i still have my rights for that.	-1
Why does Trump want to be President again anyway shouldn’t they do as usual, hand it over to the demos and let them deal with this mess for 4 years then the repubs can come take it back as usual and have a clean slate. I never hear repubs say our hand are tied yet that’s all I hear from demos. It’s obvious that demos went wrong somewhere because they have no power. Had so many demos not voted for Trump we would not be in this situation; nevertheless I still had to vote for the lesser of two evils, It is what it is.	-1
I can't tell if this is a debate or a Call of Duty voice chat lobby.	-1

Trump won that debate. Hhhhhuge.	93
Ya know I think that's BS.  Count the ballots now and as they come in.  If you didnt vote by Nov 3, tough.  Unless you are bed ridden there is no reason to not vote.  I went early and was maybe 6 people.  I wore my mask, but probably didnt even need it.  This oh wait until 2 weeks.when we count all.these ballots	-1

Biden's answer to court-packing question is because he will face the US justice judgement on conflict of interest, corruption, money laundry, and treason crimes.	-1
It`s so difficult to maintain a debate with Donald Trump, not because he shows good ideas, but because he is very disrespectful.	-1
It's sooooo annoying when someone keeps interrupting you from talking like jezus...	-1
Why can’t Biden ever answer the question. He adds press logistics not realism. He blames Trump for COVID, but messed up on a virus that is far less worst then COVID.	-1
Hummmm 🤔🙄	-1
it gets me pissed off that trump says okay go ahead but keeps interrupting moderator said “ you can speak NO INTERUPTIONS”	-1
They should use a shot clock with the timer running down, that buzzes and turns mic off after 2 min.	133
Trump: your son was dishonorably discharged from the military.  Biden: not true  Trump: for cocaine use.  Biden: not true   Biden: Like a lot of people at home who has a drug problem.   Me: 😂😂😂😂😂😂 no I don’t know anyone with a drug problem buddy also 2 second ago didn’t you say it wasn’t true?    This was way funnier than Trump and Hilary.	-1
"""First of all, I guess I'm debating you not him but that's okay I'm not surprised""         - Trump @ the debate moderator after the moderator was trying to ask him a question and Trump kept talking over him  literally not even 10 minutes into the debate jfc"	-1
I gotta say, that moderator was pretty cool.  I mean normally they bash one or the other - he criticized and called them out both equally.  If only our next president, whoever that will be, would do that LOL.	-1
This reminds me of arguing with my little sister when I was like 15, neither of us knew what we where talking about all we knew is that the other person was wrong	-1

You Trump supporters are all a bunch of brainwashed motherfukers try using your mind or don't you have one? Is our country better or worse than when he came in you're going to say it's better cuz he told you so well it's not better worse then it ever has been	-1
Not only is he a shity president the worst one in my lifetime he's not even a good human being and the people who follow him are no good to they act like they're above the virus while they're dying. They're not the only ones that fly flags Trump supporters really suck ass that's what I think Trump is a big orange piece of shit that's what I think I don't like him is a human being let alone as a president I wouldn't want him for a friend I don't like him I don't care if he gave me 1 trillion dollars which he doesn't have cuz he's not even a good businessman look at our country it is the worst it's been since the Vietnam War yes I'm old.

The USA has been in chaos for the past 4 years. We can no longer go on this way. Remember what Nikita Khrushchev said that they will distroy the USA from the inside.  They will not lift a finger. We will do it ourselves. Is this what we are seeing today ? Is Khrushchev prediction coming true ?	-1
Vote Libertarian if they put somebody else on the ballot, or vote Megatron... I don't care. Just... everybody vote for SOMEBODY ELSE	-1
"Biden has a tendency to attack opponent before answering the question, i.e., ""the difference is millionaire and billionaire like him...,"" instead of focusing on answering the question directly about the ""K shape"" recovery and we, the public, would never know what the ""K shape"" recovery is.   Perhaps, it is better to focus on answering the questions directly to be a better and more effective speaker.  The issue of Biden's sons should not even be discussed because this is not a trial about his sons, so one has to be careful about answering these so-called ""baits"" questions which cause us to be sidetracked."	-1
Did he really just almost say we have the lowest carbon footprint? What?!??	-1
i think for debates like this, the mediator should be able to turn on/off the canidates' microphones cus they seem to be talking over each other A LOT lol	-1

Biden bashes trump about things out of his power. The democratic state leaders are destroying their states to make trump look bad and trump cant intervine because its the states choice. Its not all trump. The governers of these states are choosing to let things go bad.	-1
What will happen mr. Biden after presidental elections? Very interesting. 🤔	-1

So much for open discussion, that first segment was a train wreck from the moderator	-1
Trump dominated this debate. On a human level.	93
fuck trump like ı dont get how anyone can be that dumb	-1
...and that was the end of Chris Wallace’s career as a TV news anchor.	-1
I think this kind debate program should start in India	-1
Idk both seem kinda sus	24
I aint from USA, but i think the way presidential debates should be is to show the candidate's own strength instead of destroying the opposing candidate	-1
did you use the word SMART!!!!	54
American Reality TV at your doorstep.	-1
Why does Biden not look at Trump?	-1
We can all agree that this debate was very entertaining	-1

All of it is shit.  It cannot be fixed.  Burn it all down.	-1
Why do we watch these things? This whole 2 hours can be summed up..... Two old guys arguing and talking over each other and not answering any of the questions Americans want answered.	-1
Keep giggling joe. My friend died from covid. You will flush this country down the tube. Ill never vote for another dem ever. Ill do push ups against any day.	-1

Hwan on the 5 love jo biden and actually thinks creepy joe won this. Idiot	-1
Stay strong americans .I hope you can save your country from the virus and from trump  Blessing from a german .	-1
I'm not an American  ( i'm half french half german )but this debate was horrifying. Trump continues to interupt  him. Biden interrupted him too only because he had to fight back and because trump doesn't stop talking. This was painful to watch i don't understand how americans voted for trump ( he keeps lying to them, insult everyone deflects blame  towards others, ) But that not the worst part . (To me at least) he shook hands with dictators ( poutine , north Korea) treathning to destroy the alliance between america and Europe. Left the Paris accord ( because let's face it he didn't believe  climate change)  And Now he is threating the american democracy by saying to extremist stand by.  I  know next to nothing about Joe biden but i know this : he is a democrat , he was the vice-president of america , and was never accused for being incompetent. He also doesn't insult or lie ( not to my knowledge at least).  So yeah Biden is pretty much an improvement compared to trump.  America as global superpower may well be over because of trump and we all know that the ambitious Xi would jump at the opportunity to become the first superpower in the world ( which is scary considering that China is not a democracy . Not offense to the people of China)	-1

there needs to be shift and a change in the next debate, like not a biased af moderater.	-1
Trumps a fucking weirdo	-1
anybody else think that blaming a sitting president about a pandemic is wrong???? and then filter it with recession and racial tension...racial tension will always be ...has been and still is...American cant legislate racism....a recession caused by something uncountable but yet the economy is coming back fast....and for covid....nobody should blame somebody for those deaths....that's dead wrong....any other president would of had deaths....and that's if these numbers they telling us is even accurate....at the end of the day....when u blame a sitting president for a pandemic and charge them with those deaths is wrong...and thats Biden and Democrats main talking point...that's sad...they dont even explain how they would of done different and thats because everything trump did they would of done but they cant say that bcuzz they disagreed with every action trump did in the beginning.....so to me that looks like manipulation on the Democrats side...theres slot of switch and bait on the left and the people who pay attention see it	-1

I had 35k people and you had 3 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣	-1
for those saying this is comedy never seen a debate nor have seen or read about other presidential debates...this is real politics...the problem is social media not the debate...in this presidential election we have both accusing the other of misconduct...this has happened before but not recently...our job as citizens is 2 divide the truth from falsehood and it looks like Trump does it very well...this is why many people support him....many may not agree with his ways but he has got the job done and for Biden...its pretty clear...he has no plans...his talking point is covid and riots...and none of that should be blamed on current admin	-1
That dude is so dumb, how to blame a person about covid. The people to blame are the people that think this covid is a joke and act irresponsible then got sick, there people that even did covid parties and how can some one say it's the President fault that's ridiculous and ignorant.	-1
Joe you are environmental wacko	-1
He was asked twice for the supreme court and twice he started to talk about something else. The world will take advantage of that man if he wins. He can't even answer the question. I am sorry but I can't have a leader like that I hope people make the right decision and not just vote because famous people asked you to do so.	-1
In my opinion I don't think either Joe Biden or Donald Trump have what it takes to be a president. Donald Trump is in no way at all president material as for Joe Biden I don't believe that he is either president material but Joe Biden is better then Donald Trump in many ways. Donald Trump got Covid19 most likely because he did not wear a mask. I agree with Joe Biden on wearing masks and Covid19. I know many people that have died due to Covid19. Who Knows even if there will be a vaccine for Covid19. Joe Biden made many points but I disagree with some of them. Donald Trump is saying we don't need masks. They might not work but its not like we know at this point we need to were them even if they don't work we don't even know. I personally would not vote but if I had to I would vote for Joe Biden	-1

"Did anyone hear Trump say to Biden that "" The blood is not in you""?"	-1
Calling him “joe” is very disrespectful. Trump is old enough to know that it is impolite for people who are not friends and don’t know each other in any kind of social sense to call others by their first name.	-1

OMG for real? I know it says Presidential Debate but isn't this supposed to be political as well so it can at least be considered a intellectual debate? Trump ain't a fucking politician why the fuck would anybody listen to him talk about shit he don't know. That's just stupid. If you're gonna vote Republican at least do it right and put someone who knows what the fuck they're doing in Charge. There is the speech Biden should have wrote. This is not politics it's a fucking joke.	-1
Should we just elect the moderator?	128
In the beginning it should have said: caution extreme interrupting, and it will make u go crazy.😂	-1
Screw trump, go biden!	356
Yeah i dont think that the crowd will be the thing that disrupts the debate 28:56😂😂	-1
Trump: 47 years and you have done nothing. Pay attention people.	102

"Actually, and this is the only thing I can say anything about from the debate, In Norway many believe that masks will enhance the risk of getting COVID due to us touching our face more often than usual because we have to fix or correct the mask. Also, some sources in Norway say that the COVID bacteria is not stopped by any fabric material, but by a special mask that's hard to get for any regular customer. I think I saw Kim Kardashian wear one. I, myself, use a regular mask to warn people from moving closer to me because there are FOR REAL no one that keeps their distance (I move like a ball in a pin-ball machine to avoid people that's passing me), but I believe that using a mask can make people remember they should stay away. And of course avoid any spit or snot of mine finding it's way towards others. However... When I use a mask, I get all these strange looks, and I've only seen ONE other person use a mask in public! ONE! It's actually frowned upon some places. It's so freaking weird to recieve these looks. I do believe in using a mask as long as one does not touch the mask or face! And of course remove the mask properly and dispose, or wash, when done with it.   I am not an American, I just want to enlighten others to what goes on in other countries. Maybe someone could enlighten the Norwegians? As long as the mask is properly handled I think it's very smart to use it, but not if the mask is not handled properly. Where is the ""How to use a mask"" information commercial?"	22

I don't like Trump but Joe Biden would make an even worse president. He's senile and can't even speak in sentence. Your 401K plans are going to go down under him big time. He's too much of a socialist for me. His son Hunter is a total scumbag. I'm voting for Jo Jorgensen the Libertarian candate on the ballot. She's better than both of them. Even if she doesn't win I know in my heart I voted for the best person for the job no matter the outcome and I don't care if people say its a wasted vote. A wasted vote is voting for Biden not because you like him but because you hate Trump.	-1
Biden is obviously our best option.	-1
when do they talk about separation of powers, the checks and balances and the senate in this debate, plz help need it for my English presentation:)	-1

Trump 2020 baby	-1
wow someone needs to make a talking stick apparently...but again that wont change trump from acting like the spoiled child he is and wont teach him manners or how to act like an adult let alone the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES instead of talking trash and telling us what you will do how about you tell us what you have done and what your plans are because you didn't do what you could have or should have with covid-19. every country should have been a way to learn what to do and what not to do but I guess you just choose doing nothing was better...nothing will change until everything changes and I don't see that happening anytime soon we need younger politicians who live everyday impacted by the problems at hand and can focus on the now and our future. these campaigns have become bullying adds instead of telling us what your going to do to better this country and what specifically your going to do for each state to deserve our votes as well as what your going to do to help this country be safe and help rebuild our economy.	-1

I honestly cannot watch this with a straight face.  edit: The moderator came up with a new rule where the moderator can mute the mic of either candidates.   Not sure if he gives the candidates a chance to not interrupt, or if the moderator does it right away, but regardless I think this is a pretty funny rule. Lol.	-1
1:16:51  Moderator: I think this debate would be better if you both stopped interrupting each other.   Trump: BuT hE dId It ToO	-1

"I hated this circus the first time I watched it but watching it again, I find it interesting that President Trump was noted for his interruptions. He clearly did not join in the fray until after Joe and the Moderator had already interrupted him many times and cut what he was saying short. 30:30-President Trump given 2 minutes to talk about Supreme Court Appointment. 31:50 President Trump finishes ten seconds early. 31:56 Joe Biden starts his rebuttal. 34:03 Joe Biden finishes (slightly past time). Trump starts talking immediately in rebuttal to that (which is standard for debates I have seen in person and on television). 34:29 Joe Biden interrupts Trump. 34:39 Joe Biden interrupts Trump. 34:52 Joe Biden interrupts Trump. 34:56 Moderator interrupts Trump (and another one of Biden's interruptions) to tell them they are in ""open discussion"" (a new concept for this debate based on all the past presidential debates I have watched). The Moderator gives Biden permission to keep speaking (despite the fact Trump was in the middle of responding to one of Biden's asides and Trump has spent less than a minute responding and was interrupted three times). 35:00 Joe Biden begins talking. 35:28 Trump interrupts Biden. 35:44 Trump interrupts Biden. 36:07 Trump interrupts Biden and takes floor after Joe asks question-Joe has had a full minute to speak with three Trump interruptions. 36.14 Joe interrupts and continues interrupting until 36:25. The Moderator interrupts Trump at 36:28. Biden and the Moderator both continue interrupting with Biden finally telling Trump to ""shut-up"" at 36:34. At 36:39, the Moderator stops Trump from talking and again turns it over to Biden despite the fact Trump was responding to something Biden interrupted with. 36:53 Trump interrupts with a question to Biden. 37:07 Biden admits he doesn't know the nominated Justice's view on Roe v Wade despite making claims she is anti-Row v Wade. 37:08 The Moderator interrupts Biden and Trump and concludes the topic.   37:57 Moderator says Trump has never come up with a replacement plan (which even I know he has-here is a blog post from someone talking about it right after the 2016 election: https://www.naylornetwork.com/cmsatoday/articles/index-v3.asp?aid=411290&issueID=53655) 38:22 The Moderator prevents Trump from stating he has a plan--and re-asks the question stating Trump has not come up with a plan! Dude, if you are going to Moderate and ask questions, (1) You cannot always give the floor to Biden; (2) You should ask questions that are politically NEUTRAL and that can be asked to BOTH candidates WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT REWORDING (i.e. a good Moderator would have said ""What is your plan for Healthcare over the next 4 years?"") (3) A good Moderator should at least do some research.   At this point, I feel confirmed in my original opinion that this was not a real debate but a staged Democratic party political ploy, and although I have voted for Democrats in years past and am not sure I will vote for Trump this year (something I wouldn't have even considered in the Spring), I am definitely sure that I am not going to vote for a single Democrat because they are stifling free speech and not letting the public see both sides. The first amendment says that everyone is allowed to share their opinions, but the Democrats want to put a mute button on Trump. Why? If Democrats have the best party and the best platform, they would let people hear what Trump has to say so the people can decide. You want a fair debate, you shut off the opposing person and the Moderator's mics for two minutes while each person is talking, and you don't have an open free-for-all where Democrat candidates can interrupt without censure but Republican candidates cannot. You choose questions you can ask both parties about their policies not politically heated, one-sided hot-points. Done watching this one and won't watch anymore, nor will I blame President Trump if he refuses to debate."	-1
Why	-1
😂😂😂😂oh lord none of these 2 candidates are SHIT!! im laughinggg hard at how they discuss each other lol	-1
Giving this a 2nd watch, Trump undoubtedly won this	-1
"I'm not American. I made sticky notes to watch it since the debate took place. So... Let's all assume that the vast majority of citizens know that every president or maybe better said, every candidate puts the accent on certain things in different measures (healthcare, economy, justice..). Despite this, in theory, a man in this position shouldn't have weak points, in reality, no one has a perfect view of anything. I will happily accept that both Trump and Bidden are right and wrong in various matters, but I (and probably everyone) simply can't accept that a presidential debate should go like this. They are speaking badly with each other but most importantly, they attack the person. ""liar"", ""clown"", ""just shut up man"", ""you can't talk to me with the word ""smart"" because you graduated in x college in x position"".. Excuse me? Are we grown-ups or what? The questions were good. I hardly pitied the moderator. The poor man shouted ""Mr (vice)president"" or ""gentlemen"" like 100 times. It's funny because it's true. It's funny but it's undoubtedly sad."	-1

As a Chinese people, I used to hate CCP cause they behave like thugs. BUT When I met Mr Trump, I was beginning to know what a real thug looks like. No man can be worse then him. CCP became holy comparing with Trump. Before the Debate I felt sad since he will continue to bully China after Re-elected, but now I want Trump to be the Prisident urgently. He will make US worse and fool American people that he did well. He will push Chinese people united. Thanks DJT	-1

Watching this you can literally see distinct personality differences between Trump and Biden. I can tell Biden is more calm and collected and shrugs off Trump nicely by laughing off his insults and putting him in his place. I can see a glimpse of compassion in him as well. Trump is more arrogant, loud, judgmental, incessantly interrupts and talks over people, and thinks he knows everything about bringing peace to America. He literally doesn't think he has any flaws in his character.   Trump assumes there is nothing smart about Biden. Biden probably knows more than he says. Who is Trump to tell who is smart and who's not. In 47 years, Biden probably gained a lot of experience in politics whereas trump hasn't done much to help build America up during the 4 years of his presidency. I personally agree more with Biden and his plans.	-1

Lies lies lies and non sense from biden.  Firstly, look at the difference, honestly, just from what you hear over here:  Trump is talking facts and success, and things he accomplished.  Biden talks mostly flowery words that seem to be an attempt to appeal to people by saying what he thinks they want to hear. Without much if any substance or things to prove past success (and he was in politics for much longer..) doing what he claims.  B  Biden is blaming violence and weaker economy on trump.  Well, look at the facts.  It was a democrat party which supported blm, which included much much violence and chaos, the news actually showing much of this.  Consistently on videos, democrats are seen attacking, even physically anyone who simply shows they are a trump supporter.  A democracy, I would think would actually support two parties and consideration of both sides, respectfully, and, obviously without violence.  Economy? It is due to a shutdown which he and the party he's supposed to represent were and are urging it to be done.  But trump is the president, the one who advocates lessoning of a complete shutdown, so they are wrongfully blaming him for their own advocated policies.  Again, he keeps on making promises, and talking as though he's speaking for the American people, saying simply saying whatever he thinks they would want to hear.  Now people are worried about the President refusing to step down right?  Well, since the President was elected, it is his side which were and continue to not accept him as President. There is more to be said. Get real.	347

Folks could get together in as large as groups as possible and go into your local walmart maskless and protest by means of shopping for basic necessity's together as a group. Sleepy Joe will without a doubt along with Dr. Faucet and whomever is running him WILL shut us down, every small business owner in the US that has not shut down all ready are at risk.

Amen!	-1

Trump is a knockout!!  He answered very competently and deliberately knocked off the thoughts of Biden and the moderator, who together were against him.  Contrary to all the rules, moderator must be a moderator only, so as not to let the debates turn into a clownery. But he deliberately tried to harm Trump and help Biden..  hope Trump will win the election!!!!!	-1

You know Joe Biden really does need to watch who he is talking to. For God sakes Trump is the president and Joe still says shut up and saying trumps a clown,show some respect. But also Trump really needs to be more like Vice President Pence.	-1
If you watch closely, Biden started interrupting first. For anyone that doesn't believe it, the talk first starts at 30:30, and the first interruption (Biden) is at 34:39	-1

59:00 wow lol	-1
For the #3 debate, seemingly not too late to make changes;  the format as the rule of mute mic came about, then don’t see the need for a moderator! I felt unfairness & bias are blatantly evidenced in the way it was conducted. Restore neutrality Let them exchange views & ideas, so voters can decide. That is what  debate is.	-1
Fuck talking give them gloves lol!!!!	-1
I got so frustrated listening to trump interrupting the moderator and biden. I just want to listen to their arguments. Just let them speak! I wanted to tell at him to shut up.	-1
"For Joe Biden to call our standing president a ""clown"", tell our standing president to ""shut up"" and to stop ""yapping""....  What has our country come to???"	-1
Joe Biden does not compared to trump Joe Biden talking about all this stuff when trumps trying to help	-1

I think they should box and winner gets 2020!	-1
I really feel bad for Joe Biden, Donald just doesn’t care and thinks everything is about himself. I mean look at his team! No masks hardly as all! Like come on, grow up and help us keep our hurting country safe. Donald is the death of this Country, we now have a terrible rep because of that “man”.	-1
TRUMP! TRUMP 2020! GO TRUMP! TRUMP IS TOTALLLLLLLY WINNNNNNINGGGGG!	-1
Trump was suffering from the Coronavirus virus during this debate and tried to give it to Biden.	-1
Como llegue aca?. Mi perro tiene mas argumentos para debatir que estos dos. Una verguenza.	-1
Trump gave facts and told us what he has and will do. I didn’t hear Biden vibe any of his ideas or plans. He just spoke his opinion on what the president has done wrong.	-1
The first person to cut the other from talking was biden. And it's like the moderator is siding with biden.	-1
we need younger people running next time....I swear being born in the 40s wasnt super old that long ago but its beginning to show in the candidates... casual young people may be toxic on social media...but we also make great political discussions too when we try...	68
Well bidden didnt want to answer a question....hmmmmm kamala did not answer a question either in her failed debate either. Trump won both rounds. Vote trump 2020	-1
The moderator should have the ability to mute mics.	133
ahh the fun shows begin... I missed this for 4 years	-1
Obama was our first black president. Trump is our first nigga president. Biden is sleep, been sleep his whole political career. VOTE FOR TRUMP  KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

EXCELLENT	246
"The statement of Biden on the segment ""How confident are you that this will be a fair election?"" Is comforting. You could actually feel the empathy and his concern to the nation almost everytime he speaks. He was just overwhelmed by a constant interuption of Mr. Trump. Yes, he's not perfect but I rather choose him than a leader who is ego-centric and always tend to sugar coat the mistakes rather than thinking how to fix it and implement solutions for a better change. At the end of the day, a sign of a true leader is a good listener and has a heart to lay down his life to his nation."	-1
50:48 I trust Trump	-1
I’m afraid to know what’s going to happen next month😭😖 Trump is a MUTT	-1
Am I the only one that noticed that Trump did not ask people to Vote?  I'm baffled as to why.	-1

Trump is just some egotistical racist orange that just can’t seem to be able to EXEPT he LOST to a black man he blinds himself with his “justice” but instead he’s just cutting people off and hurting more then he’s helping by just doing THIS	-1

Weak moderator. Ruined this opportunity	-1
We are all doomed	-1
"People keep commenting that its trump vs biden and the moderator. Does it ever occur to them that this is trump versus reality? The moderator is not bias, they have to interject to keep information accurate, and airtime fair both of which are in public interest. If trump violates those principles more, I am sure to his fans the moderator seems ""biased"". But your issue is with the moderator attempting to keep the debate on course when your issue should be with trump trying to derail it. He gets nervous and impulsive every time Biden is making a valid criticism or academically informed point. So he squirms and interrupts. Trump couldn't win a debate in which he was allowed to interrupt and a Fox (i.e. republican) moderated. Good luck debating next week with the new debate rules including muted microphones donald. Congratulations, your campaign is in the toilet."	-1

I'm having a headache listening to these 2 grown men acting like kids fighting over talking to each others 😑....	-1
God bless you president Trump	243
Trump is just a manipulator. The first words that came out were bs and that’s scary. He receives information from every and any  source then tries to shove that information in his own words to people to make them feel like their wanted , to get into their heads. Once he’s in your head then he’s in your heart once he’s in your heart then he’s in your feelings; You start to feel good about him because you think he has been and will be a great president and now you feel like he cares. News flash baby he don’t give a fuck and he even said that so my loves neither should you. And I feel like joe is trying to speak for the people because he knows people are fed up he actually wants to make a change. Trump is just beating  around the bush. Joe was right trump has done nothing  these past 4 years but talk shit. If he actually wanted to make a change he would’ve if he wanted to make things better he would’ve. Trump is saying random things that have nothing to do with this debate, nothing about corona, nothing about the Supreme Court and nothing about the economy. He cares about nothing but himself and we see that everyday buttttttt He’s just a good shit talker that people cling to. It’s time WAKE TF UP GUYSSS!!!!!	-1
Trump!♥️🌈👍	-1
I feel like I know enough that I could have  debated with trump lol.  He doesn't go anywhere with the shit he says lmao. This is scary	-1

The moderator spent Christmas with Joe Biden and Barack Obama in 2018 check it out if you don't believe it	-1
I'd say Trump won this one regardless.. bottom line.. Biden wants to shut down everything without fully considering the wide scale ramifications of doing so.. now that we are more familiar with how COVID and realize it's not as dangerous as first expected.. there is no longer justification for the shutdown the world is going through..	-1
Trump- “Woah woah, did you just use the word ‘smart’ ? Uh, so you said you went to Delaware State but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware state. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest of your class. Don’t ever use the word ‘smart’ with me. Don’t ever use that word, because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you Joe. 47 years and you’ve done nothing”.   Somebody send me an ambulance. I’m crying. 🤣🤣🤣🤣😢 smoked like a fucking chimney. 🤣🤣	-1

Sound?	-1
"The name ""Annoying Orange"" Has a totally different meaning now."	-1
I sympathize with Biden and have been interrupted by trump countless times. I think that as a debate, we should at least listen carefully before the other party speaks, and we should not interrupt others at will. This is the minimum quality.	-1
im voting for joe          JOE MAMA	82

Trump did not cause a recession. China caused the virus, which caused our economy to go down. The democrats have tried to destroy our duly elected president Trump in ridiculously, unimaginable ways during his entire term. It's blatantly obvious that democrats don't want a non-politition in office or a republican, and MSM is blatantly being backed by them. It's ridiculous!!!! I will never trust a career politician, or MSM again... NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!!	-1
As an outsider hearing this speech from India, it seems Joe biden doesnt seem to have any idea of anything, no facts and no plan. He is only trying to become emotional to fool the public to vote for him.	-1

"I really hate how Biden keeps talking directly at the camera and addressing ""the American people."" It sounds so fake and patronizing."	-1
Just to give you perspective on the destruction this president has done to business and the economy (just like he’s done to his own businesses) this is a man who managed to bring the Walt Disney company to its knees. So many people have had to go home who devoted their lives to that company. Now realize how many companies have it worse off than Disney. Good job trump. You tore our families apart.	-1

"I read on someone's post that Biden might be wearing ""Smart Contact Lenses""...that makes a lot of sense... it explains why Biden kept closing his eyes, kinda squinting with his lips curled up as if he was about to cry..

I wouldn't put it past them to help him try to make sense..... https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2020/01/ar-smart-contact-lens-lets-wearer-see-the-world-in-a-whole-new-way/?fbclid=IwAR2YUYiBsIk1JplLhyM8QmXzJxes1HMgECDj2FQZu7ZPSVH-NICIsq5abk0#.X40OfFkvWX0.facebook"	-1

Anyone that elects/reelects Biden all your doing is reelecting Obama for a third,and fourth term.	-1
If we were to take a shot everytime the moderator of the debate said 'gentlemen' we would be piss drunk rn 😂	-1
here's the thing about the Trump tax cuts. if Biden cuts them and make the countries pay their fair share. they will ship their businesses elsewhere and sell the product to americans. The whole point of the tax cuts is to even out the wage gap other countries provide compared to the united states, which is much higher in the USA. therefore the government pays for the wage gap in exchange for American jobs.	-1
I am a 💯 sure that Donald Trump will be the continuing President.	-1

Are you guys embarrassed? Are you embarrassed that these people represent you? And this goes for all politicians and governments from local to Federal. maybe at one time we had a good government but now it is 100% massively corrupt, now we do have good people trying to enter into government to try to make a change but we're dealing with a mass correction problem. But remember this Mass corruption cannot continue forever it's already been exposed by the light. Now watch it Fall apart on a massive scale.	-1

Whoever wins, we all need to stop hating each other for liking the 'wrong' guy. Everyone thinks they are supporting the best person. It doesn't make them a piece of shit. The media have completely manipulated us all over the last 4 years to be divided. We have to stop being puppets and stop the division. You can vote for a different candidate without being 'evil' or 'a moron'. More importantly than who is president is how we treat each other and, and that we fix the division in USA. Come on guys enough is enough. Let's stop being puppets for the media. Stop hating on each other.	-1

Who knows anything about psychology or non verbals would never pick Biden who is like a snake with no real argument but theatrical laughter instead of straight answer and personal attacks instead of facts. It’s not about being president but bring trump down and in a manipulative way trying to appeal to people and taking them hostage.	-1
I love how trump made less since than Biden... The man with dementia.	-1

I bet the last presidential debate will not take place. The Biden campaign will come out with some lame excuse because they don't want him in front of the president with this huge Scandal over his head. Biden's a crook, liar and has been compromised by the Chinese government	-1
China ate your lunch joe	90
For the first time I got to see the real trump upon watching this debate, he's worst than a kid, and so wrong. We all know he's racist, since he couldn't answered properly, and is my first time voting, that's for sure I ain't voting for him. There's no place in this world for racism and stupidities like his.🇺🇲🇲🇽😷	-1

"I've seen how expensive ""Obama Care""  can be . The insurance companies are making a killing on it. They are slaughtering an entire families income.  And ' if the family can't afford the premiums then the ""Welfare System"" pays the families monthly  premiums. Up to an incredible $6,500.00  a month in premiums (for a family of five )  to the insurance companies, paid by ""Welfare"" which in turn is paid by the American tax payers. Multiply those premiums by millions and millions that go to the insurance companies . What did we get ? Extraordinary high co-pays, high cost in prescription ( RX ) medications, higher costs in physician's visits and services. Hospital bill's that are so sky high they leech off the insurance companies who are ripping off the public and government . Our health system is broken and it needs repairing like now !"	-1
44:40 Trump can’t even let Biden speak....Trump is a pure rude man	-1
BIDEN IS CANCER TO AMERICA💀💀	-1

That guy on the right has some sort of psych issues	-1
Mics should of been muted	-1
Smh🙄	-1
As soon as Trump starts talking about Hunter, Chris jumps in to interrupt. This gives plenty of time for Biden to recover and get additional information to respond from the person in his ear. Good luck.	-1

Here’s the deal	18
Stone Cold Steve Austin should step in in the next cage match and settle the matter.	-1
I’m not on either side but you can’t just blame a president for the Black Plague, I honestly think he did the best he could and the evidence wouldn’t suggest otherwise. Like he says, even democrats supported his moves during the corona outbreak.	-1
HE CALLED HIM LIL BUDDYYYY AHHHHHH	-1
I think that simply  when  one speaker talks, turn off the other mic~ Why didn't you do that?  it will bring better conversation for sure.	-1

the vice presidential debate was so much better.	-1
Watching it from India	-1
Independent: Trump Won this debate and Kamala won against Mike! Total confusion. My Vote for Trump is when He truthfully said democrats got pissed at him for stopping people with covid from coming here and Yes, individual mandate on healthcare is unconstitutional, because it allows a martial law like system. The only way Joe will pull off a win is with free college education, free healthcare and placing a cap price on clothing, Mortgage/Rent and Auto industry.  Otherwise it's pointless. I don't want to see rich people get taxed harder because then they gone hire machines to do the job, and this will prevent new businesses from growing, I dont wanna see mandates on healthcare it allows for implantable micro chips, and I don't care about Russia nor China's or Foreign economy.	-1
Its sad but seems like Trump is just having fun toying with Biden.    However because its kinda obvious Bidens head is not in the game its like he doesn't know what's going on . no  game plan and he can't answer the debaters question at all .   Trump is simply on a much higher level .   I dnt think Biden is a bad person but i believe Democrats would want Biden elected just because he would be a yes man and allow who ever to make the decisions.	-1
Trump needs to get elected this year, the democrats are literally evil, I don’t know what imma do if trump doesn’t get elected	-1

28:00 thank me later	199
I feel sorry for the mainly democratic audience, they look like dangerous muzzled dogs. It’s  a sad inditement on our society.	-1
This video is for the hypocrites who criticized Trump on this debate: This is Hillary and Bernie doing the same thing. Don't recall all of you Democrats complaing about that. https://youtu.be/IojsF5gaLK0	-1
Like this war is really just A different brand of war Like it doesn't cater the rich And an abandon the poor Like they understand you In the back of the jet When you can't put gas in your tank These fuckers are laughing their way To the bank and cashing their check Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect  For a leader so nervous In an obvious way Stuttering and mumbling For nightly news to replay And the rest of the world Watching at the end of the day In the living room laughing Like what did he say?  -hands held high by linkin park	-1
We shall become the weakest nation very soon.	-1
We are screwed 😞😞😞 what happened to the governmental system of process as to who can run for president. This era has become a circus. We have nothing but clowns running our government.	-1

They don’t get enough time to talk	-1
Joe Biden is such a fake fraud who lazily and obviously just caters to what people want and more importantly want to hear. I wouldn’t trust my future daughter even alone in the same room with the man.	-1

"So this is me before watching it im keeping an open mind :D  Update 1 hour in Trump shut the fuck up. Trump again ""no one will show up"" Joe...just joe...  Random update but when Joe said ur the worst president I had to laugh   Edit im done. Im so confused  It was all fun and games Till one of them is gonna be the president"	-1
None of the people trust the president anymore, they have failed the people and they have failed to gain the trust of the people. Im scared of thing will go downhill from now on.	-1
Trump tells the truth about antifa	-1
Trump builds suburbs. What do you build obiden? Nothing. Your a destroyer..	-1

I trust Pres Trump exclusively!	-1
You want to shut down the economy NOW Joe!	-1
He knew? You and Crazy Nancy wanted to keep the borders open. Nancy said come on down to Chinatown, ftlog! He’s xenophobic right? You two are nuts!!! Take your cracked skull and your crazy colleague and just retire Joe.	-1
47 years of serving himself. Obiden sucks	-1
Thats right Mr President. The people do understand. The ones who are informed by reputable news sources.	-1
In fact he has offered a plan but the Dems will not approve it because they want a socialist run health care.	-1
Vote for trump	193
Chris Wallace is very rude. He makes statements that are not true and then absolutely gives him no platform to actually speak the truth. Clearly this is about spreading propaganda by the biased media. Chris you should lose your job because of your disrespect and lies.	177
Moderator must be so tired🤣	-1
Didn’t Biden fight for segregation ?	-1
Bring back Barack Obama	175
The fact they started this off civilly was amazing.	-1
Look at Biden jotting down notes WHILE Wallace is asking about the Covid vaccine starting at 45:38.  Then when Biden  answers, at 46:09 he looks down a few times to those brand newly written notes to spout off numbers and percentages. Amazing how he was able to pull those figures from his memory banks YET needed to write them down while also listening to the question - just so that he could be sure to not forget to reference them 30 seconds later. Bah! He was being FED what to say somehow! I mean seriously, if he knew the figures off by heart, why write them down now seconds before conveying them??? Why need to look down at them at least 3 different times to ensure accuracy if you just pulled them from the deep recesses of your brain??? Grrrrr.	-1
The SNL version made more sense :)	-1
Trump sounds like a child.	-1

Stop voting for these clowns. Vote jo jorgensen	-1
😱 Dictionary definition of Presidential: “having a bearing or demeanor befitting a president; dignified and confident.” Currently demonstrated definition of presidential: attack the opponent like a savage beast to prove your worth but at the end of the fight you both have claw marks and wounds, and have not proved your worth.   Historic purpose of American presidential debates: to tell the American  people what you aspire to do for them while president; sell yourself in the best light possible. (Kind of like crafting a resume). Currently demonstrated purpose of American presidential debates: to convince the American people the opponent is a jackass and a liar and you shouldn’t vote for him; trash him going as below the belt as possible. All while NOT telling us what YOU will do while president. (Kind of like slander or libel)	-1
He’s a fool on this.	-1
Kamala Harris is the best now. Trump damaged US economy by being racist towards China. US government and companies rip off the world, the President must talk nicely at camera so the world wouldn't hate USA. If China destroying US economy by politics and new disease wasn't enough, Trump restarted Iran's nuclear project by breaking the contract. What's next? World war 3?	-1

I wanna throw up 🤢 joe you have no clue about politics 47 years nothing done!! The recession lol what about the recession in 2008?????? You asshole fuck you and your crappy lefty ideology	-1
I thought id tune in to this comedy show but I am someone who has never voted and will never vote and thats for moral reasons. I will never listen to someone trying to guilt trip me into voting by saying by not voting I'm contributing to the evil candidate. In my eyes both parties do evil things.   Neither side appeals to me. It seems like, when choosing one party or candidate vs the other, you have to accept a whole lot of stuff you don’t agree with along with the things you do agree with. People in power are all crooks anyway. Consider Trump vs Biden.   Both sides said the other was the devil. The truth? Both sides are right, at least on this one. Trump vs Biden brings up something else: how can I possibly be motivated to get out and vote if doing so means facing choices like THIS?Politics is just a whole lot of nastiness.   People argue over it. People fight over it. Friendships are broken over it. Family members stop speaking to each other over it. Is this REALLY something you WANT to be involved with? I mean, the world is nasty and divisive enough as it is. Who is REALLY ‘right’?   Both sides say their way is the ONLY way, and the other side is bad. But all in all, the economy can go bad with either side in power. Wars start with either side in power.   Nobody REALLY seems to be able to get things right. Both sides just look like a bunch of incompetent fools who only THINK they are right. Meanwhile, they enjoy blaming EVERYTHING on the other side when things go wrong. Too dogmatic.   Both politicians and highly political folks put party rules and conventions above all else. Common sense and practicality mean NOTHING. Why would I want to partake in a system that puts party above common sense and (most of all) the people? Too negative. Politics is all about making the other side look bad.   Politicians spend VAST amounts of time and energy to do so. And negative campaigning has been the rule forever. The world is negative enough. Do we REALLY need to make things worse.   Disinterest. There are MANY other things that interest me FAR more than politics. It doesn’t really affect me. Neither side is going to do anything that will TRULY improve the life of the average person. Furthermore, there are other pursuits that benefit me FAR more than politics.	-1

This was just a long children’s fight on the playground during recess..	-1
The lines are for TRUMP and the base he has. Supremecy/Criminal base. That's what your looking at. The 'lincoln' project is lincoln Nebraska Supremecy refrence - reverse psychology - noticing his 'orange' face not the nominees record for Supreme Court who took money for telling groups how to reverse EEOC guidelines - the 'Orangeman' face is Peep O Day look em up - Proud Boys are their American wing their German wing includes Nazi Nick. Ignorance will cost us our country - so don't be a 'sucker' and vote these very dangerous loosers out - you might not get another chance.	-1
What a fucking shitshow. The moderator can't even control 2 clowns. It's pathetic that these are the games they play at others' expense.	-1

Joe's a fkn billionaire off of OUR BACKS!!! Trump is one of US because he's not a sleezy politician lining his pockets with ppl less fortunate. His silver spoon came from his family then his work ethic Joe's came from the American peoples taxes, trust and sacrifice. Joe is a fkn weasel	-1

https://youtu.be/o1AZON6ZsQc If you want truth view video. Copy and paste watch and listen to it all before making mind up. https://youtu.be/nIjaLmOTkEE Wake up America do you want corruption in White House of money laundering, sex trafficking, pay offs you love ones killed and cover up like Barisma and pay offs Biden’s got there are documents out there in the senate.gov/ emails in there own words as well as charges. But they don’t want you to know this. There hiding the truth do you don’t see this and removed the site that had paperwork on it except I copied down so people will know.  The truth and we’re to find it. Go to :  rudyscommensence.com   This site is Giuliani and he has all the truth on his documents on their web page so you can see them directly with Giuliani. If you don’t believe me go to blazingpress.com look for their website for Giuliani their video clip that they had and it tells you exactly detailing this, in there own words Hunter and Biden emails , to where to go on the site and you can see all the emails and everything that they had on there that Biden and Hunter said and they’re covering pay offs to whole family as well as to Hunter and Biden on China, Russia and two other countries. On millions. Its all up and their trying to hide it so you don’t see it.  Let the truth be know! I cannot hide what millions have seen already but the video clips the people have not seen they are deleting them but the only thing is if you take a snapshot showing the site where people can go and look for it helps because I can’t erase the Snapchat‘s. These webpages that I’ve posted have seen by millions of people already and they cannot erase them. My suggestion is that you go and search them out and see for yourself with your own eyes. I don’t want a president in there that’s going to be lying to me that’s taking money and payback’s. And covering up the truth because they’re getting paid off and they got paid off more than burgers and I believe me because it’s all in the documents and their emails in your own words. Giuliani I’m his webpage has the documents that came off of a hard drive of Hunter Bidens. Hunter took his laptop and they get it corrected because he was having a problem with it or on it on the hard drive they found corruption and they turned it in to the law and they took it from there. That’s how He got caught and his father is trying to cover up his errors I did Niang it and lying about it when they’ve got them already that he lied to the American people right on video. You guys are all being lied to when he says he does not know the truth about this he does he was fully aware of the situation. Because it talks about who the players are in all these emails and it tells how much people that paid off even they hasn’t even the Joe Biden‘s brother is in there and one of the deals as well as his family and the Army there’s a letter they are directly from Hunter to Naomi telling it all. I don’t care which way you guys vote all I do is want to tell the truth and let the truth be out there so you guys know the truth and not for it to be covered up like they’re trying to do and pulling the sites. But like I said these websites that are on here they’ve been seen by millions of people because he cites one of them is a very Christian site and has been seen by many of Christians across the country so people can go out there and look at it for themselves. Instead of reporting and half the truth This is the truth.	-1
The debate mention of the idea of ANTIFA, merely meaning anti-fascism is a propagandized idea with the goal of blaming those whom elitists wish to rid themselves of because we are becoming a greed based problem.  When a people, A NATION of people, cannot survive their is a natural reaction. ANTIFA is merely the natural reaction of survival.  When you control the nations riches, it’s money, it’s means of survival, you control people’s reactions and beliefs.  And so this becomes the elitism last resort to invest in - humanity.  We can’t have the concept of fascism, when a nations poor lower middle to lower classes keep getting poorer.  This is an oxymoron unless the plans are set to turn a Constitutional nation and turn into a private nation, an aristocracy.  The fascism is an “anything goes concept” void of any form of governing body. It aims to take advantage of and intimidate impoverished segments of that nation’s poor, needy, its perceived, undesirable and demonize them and then bring them out into the streets, blame them and assassinate them. This has the potential of becoming a new modern day holocaust.  This is the Confederacy rising up again. It’s a private nation refusing to become a Constitutional nation. An example of “anything goes” is slavery and how fascism evolves to survival of the fittest style, predatorial society.     This leads to Christianity and Religion traditionally falling into persecution.  Republicans know one thing MONEY and GREED as the CORE governing concept. This is simply put corruption and decay as its end result, and even an occult concept.     University political science professors, influential representatives need to step up and educate the public now, clout and influence is needed before ignorance follows this path even further.  These concepts are built into the pathos of Trump and the party’s political wants. Elitism is what makes him and many like him pathologically inclined and empty hearted.  This is Satan’s Pathos, the money root of all evil, riches rots a man’s heart and leaves a nations needy out to survive and fend for themselves.  Fascism runs in Trump’s vains without him even knowing it’s meaning and ideology. It is pathological greed AT ANY COST...you and I in the millions amounts to they’re survival. This is the beginnings of a modern holocaust.	-1

I am personally not a fan of the democracy concept of giving the decisive power to the majority which I judge to be mostly hill informed, but I found that it is ironic and hypocritical to call the current political deception a democracy.  What would be a REAL democracy? you wouldn't vote for people that mostly represent your wants and needs. you would vote directly for those wants and needs, i say we cut the middle man, with modern technology we no longer need to elect representatives, that mostly aligned with our vision. people could vote directly on the amount of tax to pay and where these taxes would go. At least in that way, you avoid ignorant blind votes and corruption. We force the new generations to vote, even when no candidate is decent. Even when they don’t even know a thing about them. People who truly follow all that the candidate proposes are not the majority. Debates are becoming less and less understandable and more and more confusing. This is not TRUE democracy!	-1
An idiot an a very old man...	-1
"When you have candidates like that on both side... and people are wondering whether this is a debate or a parody. the political climate is a joke... a rigged contest. where in 2020 we no longer need to vote for representative we have the technologies to represent our-self, you want real democracy don't vote for people that share mostly you idea. vote directly for your idea, cut the middle man. change the political system. read book and study be well informed, i suggest you all take a look at ""Utopia for realist and how to get there"". it explain why most idea that recent presidents have been pushing are counter productive to the goal sold us. just to be clear this ""Debate"" is a complete joke..."	-1
I’m getting it like water it’s so cheap 😂😂😂😂	-1
I’m a born & raised Ohioan. Mr. Trump- you did NOTHING TO HELP OHIO. We are struggling so fucking bad! There’s no funding, no jobs what jobs there are is fast food. So you’re telling me my husband who has been making almost $25/hr for years and is now out of work has to take a job making $9/hr?? Please. You’re ridiculous. Not to mention how much federal taxes he pays every year? Is that fair? He pays thousands and you only pay $750? The fuck dude.	-1
No. Veto. Abolish the 2 party system and give us new candidates that care about the people.	-1

Mr. Biden is able to say a lot of things about trump because Mr. Trump is already a president, but lets see if aftr 5 yrs if he is in power, im sure a newer candidate would also smash with all the faulty things about their government. He just looks like a clean slate because he hasnt done anything yet.	-1

Maybe the public should be their own president. I think biden wants it bad as well as trump but I think they still don't have enough answers because if they did they wouldn't have to argue , so what does that tell you	-1
It's kinda crazy to bicker instead of discuss how you would make the world a better place. This election is scary because there wasn't enough of their individual plans expressed on how to help the planet(s). I think they need to focus on what's going on ,on earth besides spending money to exploit other people planets. I agree police brutality should be discussed as well as what they are going to do to fix this	-1

"Biden is Former Vice President. Sorry, dont feel safe (didnt before either); dont see leadership in Biden. Hes having difficulty; is unable to answer direct questions fully when confronted. Again, Biden says absolutely nothing. No place for socialism in the U.S., period!- The virus was noones fault in the U.S.- Leaders of the World did not know how to deal with this new unknown virus, yet Biden blames Trump. Biden is rude and disrespectful and points his fingers at the President and the viewers and he says hes ""in favor of law and a little bit of order"". 🙃 There does need to be better care of our forests. If you spend time in them or pay visits to our forests, hunt, hike, ride and walk trails you know it. Neither one of these men is a savior. There is only one savior, the Lord. Dont think anyone can get all this country needs done by one President. We all need to work together. Watching this debate is proof we have problems in this country working together. President Trump has worked hard and has done a great job. I feel he has had to deal with more negativity than any other President that i know of and has done more than any other President in a long time to overcome it. Patience, Respect, Accountability need brought back to our country. 🇺🇸"	-1

I really don't like how they just the lighting on the President and vice President They make the president look Brown As if a severe suntan They make the presidential candidate look red he has a red face It's identity disgrace! I don't like how the president of the United States debated the naperator.. I don't like how we switch the subject and the president cannot complete his thought and want him to question too, most complete bias Wallace was 100% for the Obama health care system he thought it was as good as apple pie, and he enjoy working people paying amazing higher premium cost , which is unfair and unethical to law,. That just depends what side of the law you're on 😚 When it came to the racial black on white  issue,  As to what the president did for the African American Democrat and Republican states President of the United States never mentioned 900 billion dollars, for interracial creation businesses and housing, new starter businesses creation 900 billion into the United States, system October 15th 2020	-1
that moment when you have 2 adult children arguing over colors and you have to decide which one controls a large portion of what you do	-1
Definite winner is Trump for this debate.	-1
I showed a two minute snippet of this in my 7th grade class today so they can see how ridiculous this was as a debate and how it was an embarrassment to our country.  Both of these men ( and I use the term sarcastically) were not the best of us AT ALL.	-1
I love how trump says make America great again, and honestly as much as I learned about history, I forgot a majority of it, but isn’t..South America and North America LITERALLY America? Just separated? Like you got Canada and Mexico as well as the u.s. and the u.s. is what fucks up everything in the first place! I don’t understand. We’re literally all Americans, but since people in the “United States” and Mexico and Canada are separated by a goddamn border we’re not all one? Like what makes any of us different? Is it the border? If so none of the states should get a long we should be having civil wars yearly. Is it the “power”? If so, that defies the idea of freedom and peace doesn’t it? Like, this country isn’t greater than anyone else. It’s just a bunch of greedy bastards that are either racist, selfish, or wAnt nothing to do with helping anyone but those who they relate to. But just a personal opinion	-1
"Biden deliberately stopped talking after ""the real problem is"", that will appears Trump is an impolite person who keeps interrupting others, and biden will can ignore the Wallace‘s question."	-1
@t get a free action for you and me. It's 100% legit, if you have any questions write me :)	-1
Former VP Biden	-1

I hate you	-1
Donald Trump	-1
Just because Trump behaves the way he does, doesn't mean by default, that Biden and the Democrats are better and have all the answers. Remember that.	-1
Biden seems like he doesn't care a hoot for America. He also seems to be dyslexic. Keeps stuttering over his words and figures.	-1
Trump: Italy is with you!	-1

I watched this again since this might be the only debate this year. LOL	-1

you'd have to be pretty fucking thick to vote for a guy like joe	-1
Man... its an excellent comedy show for us Non-American,  how tf did this clown be ur president lol. The Vice President is more suitable in my opinion.	-1
"28:52 ""The candidates will not shake hands""  Trump's mind: Hell no! Biden's mind: Good Lord, thank you"	-1
Who the fuck is gonna legalize marijuana gentleman? If neither than I ain’t voting for shit.	-1
the fact that one of these people, who can’t even be respectful during a debate, will be president and currently are president really worries me for the state of this country. The debate is for citizens to be informed and what do i hear? a lot of blah blah blah and talking over eachother like children fighting over a toy smh	-1
29:27 he put his fists up lol	-1

Look at this Lord, arguing like children. Imma keep the U.S.A in my prayers, I have hope. Even tho I’m not old enough to vote, I feel so much convenient. Because we know how Biden wants to be seen, as a trendy republican who wants equality, he’s all talk. But Trump, Trump is a different kinda bad, but let’s be fr, he did a good job being a president, as far as actual presidential business goes. I don’t like trumps social views, and his social views and societal comments are very problematic. I just can’t support trump at all. But neither can I support Biden. 💆🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ just vote yallll	-1
Poor Chris, I hope he got the day off afterwards.	5
it is what it is.	1
what a shit show, I often forgot it was a presidential debate	-1
Start of debate: 29:33	85
This is funny 😄 these guys are children	-1
I asked myself the significance of the debate....and my first thought was I'm so glad General Mills brought back Boo Berry cereal...and of course Frankenberry. But Count Chocula is my favorite 😉makes my heart leap✌️	-1
Trump I don’t know if he’s stupid they asked him a 100 times what his health care plan was? Maybe if Chris Wallace could write it on a display in big letters or Wallace could read question slowly so this idiot could understand it?	-1
44:46 I found it don't worry	-1
"as much of a disgrace  Trump is and has always been, this is the most undemocratic ""debate"" in the history of it all. Trump should NOT be allowed to be his pathetic, arrogant and obnoxious self, not when the country is at stake. Have you got no morals left ? if so, put them in separate rooms with a microphone and when his 2 minutes are up, you shut his mouth down !!! It is impossible to even think with his fucking mouth in the background ! and then complain everyone is against him including the moderator, when in fact the actual fact is that he can't stand hearing facts and truth, and he can't stand democracy itself ! fuck you Trump and please to god make this stop !"	-1
This is why the rest of the world is laughing at us. No matter who wins we are now a joke. Politics is nothing more than middle school games these days.	-1
American Democracy will die reason #1: Biden will make it worse, prolonging our governments institution by trying to run them the same way it is. Even if he changed the way our government works, we'd still be in the same circumstances we lived in.  American Democracy will die reason #2: Trump will turn American democracy into American imperialism. At least he's not trying to run it but killing democracy's head like a shotgun than  having it slowly bleed out. I get it, kill it if you have to when our current democracy doesn't work at all. That's his point.  American democracy will die reason #3: No matter who wins, or whoever the president will be, America will eventually turn into an authoritarian form of government. I wouldn't be surprised and Ancient Rome exactly transitioned from representative democracy to an empire.  My opinion: If America's current government has to die because what we have doesn't work, get it over with. I'm not right, left, or liberal, just get it over with. I'm done with voting when my/your/our voice isn't heard, just tell us what to do already cause Americans already confused.	-1
It’s been 4 years already 😂?	-1
Biden is a great man and a great political.	-1
Just watching this, you should realize that Trump is literally a three-year-old in the body of a Cheeto.	-1

If I choose between Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, I would choose Parkinson's. Better to spill some whiskey on your pants than forget where you put the whole bottle. Sean Penn.   But I’m wondering, all those who come to his rallies, as well as those who will vote for him standing in line, do they understand at all who they vote for? After all, he is one step away from being declared incapacitated.	-1
I can’t believe what other countries think watching this.	-1
01:19:11 I don't know if anyone will read this as I am undoubtably late, but as a 19 year old who has grown up with a democratic father (by who the way I love more than life itself and despite political leanings that will never change), I also am currently growing up in Canada/california I can tell you that even I can tell you this shit is BS, I have been given every easy chance to choose bidden's side, what made me hopeful right now is despite the fact that I've lived in these overly democratic states, I can see a clear, underground, reasonable conservative base coming within GenZ, hopefully, it isn't spoiled by over misinformation by the left	-1
I feel like Michelle Obama should’ve went for President	-1
Whos bright idea was it to not mute the mic of the person not speaking, I guess chaos just gets the views.	-1
Trump is literally a child	272

Trumps Face at 41:12 😂	-1
Trump 2020!!   Yet another victory in my view. This debate all set up!!  Biden slept the last 40 plus years.  This Mexican American is Trump for 2020!!  I hope everyone has been investing in the stock market.	-1
