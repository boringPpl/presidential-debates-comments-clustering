"March 17, 2021 Speech ""I Can"" by Nathaniel Morris   Oppress by pandemic as a legal war of depression someone is the remedy being their sacrificed soul. Granting us the peace we repetitiously   fight for with every breath. We must look into our hemisphere from the kingdom of space as a successful journey to the moon.  Viewing the trace of our paws leaving behind the suffering gospel of failure a coalition with the spectacular urge of inducing affliction,  to the barkers saying that red white and blue is competent. We must overwhelm God's wrath with exaggeration on the body of the leader of deficiency  making power not downplaying the secrets of the weakness of our sacrifice.   We will not allow the loitering of the family of the boastful but willingly and comfortably declare with pain the nation we are the greatest country in the world. We will represent the globe as America making it a righteous world.  We will straighten out the north and south pole with the provision of birth of God Jesus Christ. The favor of the adversary as God of this world is not what we seek.  But I am working through the plainness of speech with my IQ a profit of happiness that which our pastors require. That will move the sorrow over the head that swear by themselves that the shedding of peace is the answer giving the enemy of man material. My words are the root so let us grow a harvest as the strong  with the answer of our conspiracy of terror.   Let the outcome be the launch of the result of consistent surveillance through the years giving the weary follower  of self produced answers that claim they can answer our desires. Biblically a promise that sacrifice will be provided and we will not negatively blot out  our blueprint and the day this bill is passed our solemn integrity self sustain not building on someone stone and heart to feel satisfied with our future.  Shout to the world that the one with the desire to pleased the endangered with words never but with the scourging of the innocent compared to our angry obligations.   I am the messenger that is comfortable with holy imperfection and that God gave us the answer in the old testament and new testament ,sacrifice. Do understand me?  World wide footage of a warrior being humbled to our picture from what we have in a relationship as citizens of The United States of America. Shut up and drive to this day by elected me as President. Quieting the annoyance of the instigating of loss of communication vice of the nations of the world bashing the embodiment of selfishness he that is hopeful of their self sustainment pleasing themselves by giving advice as a good Samaritan."	-1

Sad to say I think Biden won this one, Trump looks to busy and focused on other things than this debate whereas Biden has a laser sharp focus because he was messing up alot in previous speeches all the time, so hats off to him for doing. That being said, the worry is that I have a big distrust of Biden and the democrats, not solely through the youtube left/right democrast/republican videos but actually watching the sentate committee meetings in full length you can tell that the democrats are intentionally/politically manoeuvring and pushing through their agendas and politics, and sad to say whilst I get this is politics they heavily do that for critical issues that affect Americans, and mainly Republicans are the ones digging into the truth and getting the facts out. Biden worries me alot as he seems to have '2nd system syndrome' where, what may have worked in the past you try to repeat it, and he seems to want to do that for this Presidency without thinking what has changed since he left as VP, and that I think is very dangerous for the country	302

What if Joe Biden's the Scranton strangler :OOOO	-1
Joe, since you took office...deaths have still occurred...are you going to take responsibility and are you gonna resign your position??  Also, schools are still shutdown...you haven’t ended anything.  Only thing you managed to do was increase the price of fuel, take jobs, and steel is up 21%.  Wtf....joe said in this debate “you said this was gonna end at Easter.”  Lmfao, you said you would end it and it’s still here	-1
I don’t care who wins the election anymore	-1
SNL skit was funny but this is gold	-1
I don't know but I don't trust this Joe Biden at all!!! I think Trump his right, He do not need to steel money cos he was rich before came to president, but that joe biden is a little bit corrupt to make all family rich I think trump is not liying... if I were american i would take care of him.	-1
I saw  joe biden crying	-1
I am from Iraq and I do not speak English, but I speak Arabic. Could you tell me why, if America entered a land that would be devastated and devastated, I think that what is in Iraq of devastation is because America and Iran have exploited Iraq. The wars that have lost, if it were spent for good, it would not have suffered from Aasin now, and America would have become indisputable, but now it is not the first	-1

trump is saying that we just have to live with covid and then biden disagrees. now he's in office and says there is no way to change the trajectory of the virus. we even have fucking fauci saying we have to mask up to 2022. trump was basically right but people are literal sheep	-1

I see a lot of comments about how bad this debate was.  This was actually the civil debate, and the first debate was the bad one.	-1

Is it me or is Trump sides look more filthy whilst Biden’s look’s more fresher.	-1
"Would you stop blaming Russia for voter fraud? It's called the deep state, Foreign intellect has been inferring in our elections for decades. They cheated in 2016 but they underestimated how many votes they needed to cheat. That is how Trump won. In 2020 They were able to rig the election using the dominion voter machines. The real numbers of votes for biden was 69 million. Trump was 80 million. They have made a grave mistake now, they tried to impeach a quote ""Private citizen"" or ""Former President"" you can't impeach a president that isn't in office. Unless He still technically is. The helicopter Trump uses is the White House Helicopter. biden isn't the president of america but a fraudulent organization. Trump was auiquited during the finale day of the impeachment trial. biden is just a puppet of the deep state and the ccp (Chinese communist party) The truth is out and for only those who believe it."	-1
Biden is just lying and ignoring what trump is saying the whole time. He didn’t get elected!! He is not the most popular president in history!!	-1
This video saved my sisters life. She was hit by a drunk driver head on, and was put into a coma, and was expected to die or be paralyzed for the rest of her life. My family had lost all hope of her ever living a normal life, and we almost took her off life support. As the process to end her life was taking place, the debate was being streamed on tv. Suddenly, she got up and turned off the tv. Thank you Trump and Biden for saving my sisters life 👏👏	-1

Biden is a beast. The Democrats want to terrorize Trump and his  supporters. Let's fight against Biden. We need to support, in word and  deed, our President Trump. More than half of Americans voted for Trump.  Biden switched the results. Our Trump has always stood for a real  hardworking honest American. People need to go out with guns and support	-1
I don't even watch my own country presidential debate but am here not even skipping for a mere 10 seconds because this is absolutely hilarious. On one hand you have biden who might or might not be a good man 100% but he sure is a presidential material compared to donald duck who thinks it's all about him and his awesome thoughts. Please wake up my dear friends in USA, put donald duckie aside and focus on rebuilding the USA together with biden, you used to be an awesome country, top 3 infact but due to one clueless disney character you're now stucked with having to rebuild your awesome country. All those followers who stormed capitol might not admit it openly but i am SURE they regret doing it because now their beloved god donald d has just cast them aside despite the fact that he was the one who instigated the whole mess that they've put themselves in to and now am suffering for believing this cartoon character by being hunted by the F.B.I please do not let him cause more mess and please put him and his family aside and focus on covid and rebuilding your country and foreign relation as all three problems were messed up by that duck who camt even stand straight, with that arched butt of his but still please focus on impeachment as he really needs to be in prison for the crimes he committed especially to those poor childrens who lost their parents. We do enjoy this comedy but at the same time am hoping you can get back on your feet fast! Why didn't they cut duckies mike more? Do you guys see his expression everytime it gets cut? God he's a clown. How did he become a president to one of the top 3 country in this world? Is he smart or is american citizens stupid for voting him in? Time will tell. God bless guys and please post more content on this clown so this world stricken by fear due to covid can all enjoy a good belly laugh!!	-1
Funny to re-watch this in February of 2021	-1

I'm willing to move forward with a Biden presidency. But Trump deserved it. Biden has had 8 years of corruption and wars. To blame a virus that we can't control on one guy is ridiculous. The Democrats did not want to close the borders at first.	-1
Small business owners: if you cannot pay your own employees a LIVABLE wage, not just a raised minimum wage, LIVABLE ($22/hr), you should NOT be in business. It’s what McDonald employees make in other countries, starting wage, along with full benefits. Their burger prices only went up .23 cents. How? Lower your profit margins between owner’s pay and employees’ pay. In our late-stage capitalist society, value of blue-collar workers is not being appreciated.	264
To Trump and his supporters:  You held rallies with no social distancing, no masks.   Yet, you’re surprised that so many republicans died due to COVID-19 and weren’t able to vote?   Biden supporters like me won BECAUSE WE ARE ALIVE in our “basements”. There. I’ve just solved your election issues. Trump fucked himself.	-1
Ha! They actually had to enforce the rules b/c of Trump! 🤣	-1
"45:37 ""Americans don't panic!"". Bwahahaha. This was the comment Trump should have taken Biden to task for. Hey Joe? Even now, five months later, people still can't get their hands on Clorox disinfectant wipes. Where have you been?"	-1

We are transitioning from an industrial age to a digital age and our generation of young men and women are only about social media.   Social media has it's benefits but it will be the death of the world.  Social media has a negative influence on the world to the point where we have lost focus.	-1

someone please explain to me why they are giving us a vaccine, when you get sick or a virus. your immune system duplicates the blueprint of the virus, or sickness, so that you dont get it again. so why when our bodies already have and create the antibodies, are you giving everyone a vaccine, when it will just inject the blueprint of the virus back into you.	111

Many Trump supporters say: he knows that the election was going to be rigged... If he knows that, why he ran the election??? Why he attended the debates??? Why he makes a fool of himself and never said a word about voter fraud in the debates??? Why he still debating with Biden??? If he knows all that about voter fraud and yet, ran the election, he is the dumbest man in the world....	-1

When I first heard about cryptocurrency I was not interested because my mindset was what changes will it bring to the world but when I began to carry out some deep research of what it is about I was more than interested because the opportunities it presents is very wide and can equally make someone wealthy. I read several posts and equally got to know about trading and some exchanges that I can equally get this done. I started to buy some bitcoin in early 2018 because the market outburst in December 2017 was more than enough for me to have a belief that yes cryptocurrency is here to stay. I decided to carry out some trading without proper knowledge of how to trade or what trading is all about and also I lack proper knowledge of how the market trends go because I was thinking that there will always be an upward trend in the market. I invested in some bitcoin that eventually ran out of the market in 2018 it didn't work out the  way I thought it will be, I was so sad i wanted to give up on bitcoin I stop trading for some months because of the fear of loss, I came across a youtube video may last year where I saw some individuals showering praises on this Expert Ronson Baylor so I contacted him, his trading signals are really accurate unlike any signals I ever have seen, he ask me some few questions at first making sure if I was making profit not losing, I put confident on him I bet you his signals are unlike others, he helped me generate my $3,000 into $33,000 in 5days and I was so amazing because I was tired of constant losing of my money. I will advise all traders or newbies to invest in his amazing platform. Here is his contact via  Email Address:Ronsonbaylor @gmail .com Tele gram: @Expert_Baylorfx WhatsApp: ☎️+ 1 5 0 9 3 4 2 7 0 7 7	-1

Congrats you now have the power and this country and all we can do is sit around and watch you waste our money change the constitution do whatever they want and clearly I don't see our country strong and proud. This election was a disgrace 75 million people voted for president Trump and the few swing states should be ashamed of themselves for being pushed around to be bullied into being dishonest. No one on Trump side believes for one second that sleepy Joe won.  He is not my president.  I am sad, angry frustrated and upset so pelosi and shumner shame on you.  You have not done 1 thing for the American people. You are the reason we all want term limits because you don't deserve to be in government.   Do us all a favor. Retire	-1

"In 1941 Shoghi Effendi (The Guardian of the Baha’i’ Faith) castigated the prevalent trends of society in no uncertain terms:  “Although Europe was the cradle of a ""godless"", a ""highly-vaunted yet lamentably defective civilization"",	 the foremost protagonist of that civilization was now the United States and that, in that country, at the present time, its manifestations had led to a degree of unbridled materialism which now presented a danger to the entire world.”"	-1
why is no one talking about the fact that trump isn't answering any questions or responding to what joe or the lady said lol	-1

47:41 'THEY'RE INTERFEIRING WITH AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY.' ??  What about The United States interfeiring with the sovereignty of countless countries in the Middle-East over the past 20-30 years? How can you not acknowledge that? When it happens to America, it's a big deal. When America does it to other nations, they can get away with it because they are seen as the policeman of the world. This is unconstitutional.  I actually think Trump is a bigger supporter of the constitution. The way he talks about bussinesses going bankrupt and the fact that you can't close down the entire country. He's right. You must advise the American people to protect the elderly and the people with a weak immune-system. You do this by not visiting your grandparents or let's say your friend who has breathing problems. But you cannot shut down an entire economy. Biden constantly says he'll take care of these dying bussinesses but he never says how. Where is the money going to come from? Handing out subsidies sounds simple but it's not right. This usually results to the Federal Government counterfitting money, the value of the dollar goes down and inflation goes up. Eventually the middle class will suffer people lose their jobs and houses. The media is constantly slagging of Trump, but he never urged his supporters to storm the capitol. Biden constantly supported the chaos caused by BLM when bussinesses were burnt down, shops were looted and countless of people were killed. Yet the media doesn't slate him for this. We live in a society were whatever the mainstream media tells you, you have to believe it. You are not entitled to have your own opinion anymore or you get called a racist or an idiot. There are a lot of problems in America and I honestly think the media is making Trump sound worse than he actually is.	-1

URGENT! THE TRUTH ABOUT COVID 19: https://michaelgchandler34blog.wordpress.com/	130
it's crazy how people overlooked what trump said about his son having covid. not only is that not how the virus works but you don't need to show symptoms to spread the virus. this is not only a massive lie but an extreamly dangerous one, thousands of americans have died because this fool refuses to take this outbreak seriously. this is why trump isn't getting a second term. not because of any fraud or media but because he let the American people down and it was all of us who has suffered.	-1

Biden sides with China. Trump is pro dissolving this relationship, what with so many Chinese rooted within the government. So, you are saying China are America's friends? Take a look at how China operates within their own grounds. It's fake communism with their leader abusing power. Sure, all leaders want their countries to be on top but censoring people in favour of advancing their vision is not something that they should be applauded for, let alone having it be accepted. Trump demanded a re-vote in counts which is fucking perfect, when has this been done before? Questioning corruption I mean. I am from Greece, this does not affect me in a lot of ways but mentally. Hopefully people here will take matters into their own hands and at least question our leaders, which btw, are beyond corrupt, even crossing the line of full censorship on ALL channels and giving bad press to individuals who are not even involved directly in this situation. It is hard doing that through full censorship but the bright side is that people are always in the talks. In other words, things are out of control and I wish we had someone like the US president that would speak up and at the very least raise awareness.	-1

Billionaire and genius Jovan H. Pulitzer by far has shown in the simplest terms to Georgia Legislators, the strongest evidence of an organized crime syndicate in the US Government of both elected officials and government workers. Supported by the disgusting hell bound demonic lying criminal media. A complete conspiracy, like Joe Biden confessed on a live internet Interview that he and the democrat party have the most fraudulent campaign in US history. This engineering genius Jovan Pulitzer just showed how republican ballots were printed differently ( all across the US) to cause them to be rejected by the Ballot Scanners controlled by democrats and sent to adjudication machines operated by evil democrats working in secrecy and then switch from Trump to Biden while the evil democrats destroyed many of the original ballots. This is what the evidence shows; the democrats stealing an election and country with all its wealth and weapons with the power and stated intention to prosecute the opposing political party. Democrats boldly lie, , cheat , steal, bare false witness, point the finger with false charges while conspiring and doing the actual crime. Speaker Nancy and the democrats were falsely attacking President Trump saying he was forcing the US Post Office to do less and slower work on the delivery of voters ballots; while the entire time Speaker Nancy was as part of this proven conspiracy , just pointing away from different ballot markings on the Republican ballots versus the democrat ballots. That’s because Nancy’ s planned steal by mass adjudications, Nancy, the ballot designer, the printer, everyone that approved the ballots the Governors the Secretary of States, the Judges and so many people that saw or knew about the ballot templates (proofs) prior to printing and changing the the laws to cause universal unsolicited mass mail out ballots and changes in time and locations of voting,  along with Dominion were all in on the crime of the Century; but They got caught	-1

"Trump has promoted a number of conspiracy theories that have lacked substance. These have included Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories from 2011. Known as ""birther"" theories, these allege that Barack Obama was not born in the United States.[64][65][66] In 2011, Trump took credit for pushing the White House to release Obama's ""long-form"" birth certificate, while raising doubt about its legitimacy,[67] and in 2016 admitted Obama was a natural-born citizen from Hawaii.[68] He later falsely stated that Hillary Clinton started the conspiracy theories.

I'm from Los Angeles. It really was the most fake vote ever made in America. In the area where I live, everyone voted for Donald Trump and some did not even know Joe Biden. As far as I know, the same thing happened in the whole city. Whoever you asked said that Trump is the best prime minister who really cares about his people. Can anyone explain where the 76% number for biden in my area came from? The biden may not have received even 5 votes. What can I say ... Let me not forget that in the place where the voting took place, those who gave us ballot papers, shouted ALL BIDEN TO VOTE. What is this??? Maybe they did not want a man who supported us for covid 19 and said it as it really should. From what we know from acquaintances and friends in recent days, in many cities in America they did not even take out Trump's ballot. But if you did not vote, you would be fined. I know of another incident where the wife of a friend of mine in Washington, where they received a phone call last night threatening that if Biden did not come out with 32 votes more, HE WOULD LOSE HER JOB. The whole USA wanted Donald to be prime minister again. We know that a major fraud was committed against him.	-1
Joe Biden is not the President.  He has dementia and he needs to stop playing his games with the People of the United States.  Joe gets nothing done and his son is a crook.

"This shit: is why the rest of the world is laughing at you. Your greedy, arrogant, patriotistic racism towards the world is shameful enough. But when you believe the words of the world government's bitches who are just on the stage quoting stone age history, thats when the rest of us understand why you guys are the dumbest. Why dont you try learn a few things from the East maybe it will make the obese nation built on genocide and rape ""great"" again. We are all slaves but if we side with the elite's attempt to use our obsession with patriotism then what? Then you have failed as a human being. A hungry family is a hungry family. Put the guns down and use your brains for once. Wake up and demand change you trigger happy money freaks. We cannot evolve if we dont aim to acknowledge that WE ARE ONE RACE.

Donald Trump for four years you’ve been doing things horrible for the country so don’t say that you ran for president because of how bad Biden is when you said that Barack Obama and Joe Biden did not do anything for the country of course they did they were president and Vice President at least Biden has a good way to protect us from COVID-19 when you’re saying that Biden will close down the country as you’re not that smart and you’re saying that just to be a bully and you want more people to vote for you instead of him he’s a nice guy he’s smart just respect people I can’t wait for you to get out of office	-1

I’m British and take a lot of notice of our allies across the pond.....this debate has only strengthened my belief that Trumpy is a complete moron....a racist,arrogant clown! No one on this planet is to blame for this horrible Virus to hit us all....but the true colours of a caring President would be to immediately get everyone together who can advise him on all aspects on actions to take! As of my writing,thank god Trumpy has been booted out as from January 20th 2021 and this gentleman,Mr Joe Biden..President Elect.. will do everything he can to reboot America,to heal the wounds of the jobless,to act on poverty....and make America a great country as it’s always been before Trumpy got his dirty hands on it!  Nobody is perfect....no one,but Joe is a normal thinking,caring human being who will do all he can to make good where it’s needed! God bless you Americans...fret not...help is coming your way very soon!	-1

In my personal opinion, All the candidates are not the best person for the job. But we're all human. So technically no one is.  All three of those men are getting older and the stress of presidency is not healthy for them some. Bernie Sanders, doesn't know much about politics. He might sound like a nice idea for president on the surface but I don't think in actuality that he'd be right for such a high position. Donald Trump is so egotistical, that's the main thing that makes him a bad president. If he could learn to be more humble, than more people would like him. I think Trump has the passion and nerve to be president along with the willingness to not back down from a fight. However he makes too many rash and impulsive  decisions. Sometimes he has made good ones. But he's personality is his biggest issue overall in office. And as for Joe Biden, He is kinda your typical puppet like president. He isn't bad, but he isn't great either. Biden has more of the political knowledge that we might need in the white house, however I worry he will be submissive to congress at times when he shouldn't be.  And my last point is this. It doesn't matter who is in office. No one is going to be a president we all can agree on. So just be happy the nuclear bombs haven't killed us yet. Cause any president who makes it out of office without the world ending is a decent one to me.	-1

I am so glad that Our New President is Joe Biden. I Loved Him when he was assisting our blessed President Obama. I know they do look forward to knowing our Family from Onboard. I am told that Trump basically left me to be attacked- had he done a better job protecting me he would have exposed the look alike of me sooner and once they did find out, that he took no measure to protect me, if he did then he would still be president.  God Bless Us All and bring us together as the Family that we are.and protect us in the meantime. Thank you to my Brothers who are trying to reach me for the understanding of mineral emissions & Hieroglyphs depicted on the pyramids and temples around the world. It will waken a true & ancient understanding that is inside us all. To my beloved brothers Thank you again for being there for me. I assure you that Aaron looks forward to our time ahead and so do I.  Till then I will continue exposing the inner circle that is attacking us and praying that we come together now but until then Happy Holidays 🎄 Stay safe ,& God Bless 🐾	-1

27:16 Trump: “A vaccine will be announced within weeks.” Righties: “I hope he’s right.” Lefties: “Liar!” 30:20 Biden: “I will make sure we have a plan.” Lefties: “That’s my boy!” Righties: “It is good to plan to have a plan.” 30:32 Trump: “The vaccine isn’t a guarantee but it will be here by the end of the year.” Names Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer.  Righties: “I hope he’s right.” Lefties: “Liar!”  Post debate “Fact Checkers” declare Trump’s comments as FALSE. Say all experts disagree. Vaccine won’t be ready until next summer.   November 8th, Pfizer announces 95% effective vaccine.  December 14th, first Pfizer vaccine administered.   So...I guess the President does have access to reliable information after all. Who’d of thunk it? POTUS knows a little more than we do. Amazing.   Let’s come back here in a few months when all the credit is given to Biden. For the record I give most of the credit to the vaccine makers but it definitely helps to have a President putting you on the spot and pushing you to go as fast as you’re capable of while doing it right at the same time.	-1

I want to give a testimonial on how i was cured of the HIV virus. A few months ago i had some symptoms. I went to see a doctor and they did a lot of blood tests, later they told me i had HIV. My doctor told me there is no cure for HIV and i felt bad,i went online looking for a possible cure for the HIV virus,i saw a post about Dr Eguabor, a herbal doctor who cured someone  HIV. I contacted him and told him how i felt. He said that his herbal medicine can cure me permanently. He sent me the herbal medicine through the courier and i received the herbal medicine a few days after he sent it. I took the herbs as prescribed by him. Before completing the medication, the symptoms ceased. I went to the doctor and had another blood test, surprisingly i was Negative. I have no longer had any symptoms,i am completely cured. You can also get him to help you if you have this virus. He also cures HEPATITIS B,CANCER,AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, GENITAL WARTS INFECTIONS,SIMPLE HERPES VIRUS,DIABETES,STERILITY ULCERS,COVID-19,SICKLE CELLS,etc.He also helps with penis enlargement and helps restore your broken relationship. Contact him by Email:dreguabor@aol.com or Call/WhatsApp on:+2348107439905	147

"Bismillahhir rahmannir rahiim. Dengan Nama Allah Yang Maha Pengasih lagi  Maha Penyayang.  Hai  orang-orang  yang  beriman,  janganlah  kamu  seperti  orang-orang  kafir (orang-orang munafik) itu,  yang  mengatakan  kepada  saudara-saudara  mereka  apabila  mereka mengadakan perjalanan di  muka    bumu    atau  mereka   berperang:  "" Kalau  mereka  tetap bersama-sama kita tentulah mereka  tetap  bersama-sama kita tentulah mereka tidak  mati  dan  tidak  dibunuh"".  Akibat   (dari  perkataan  dan  keyakinan  mereka) yang demikian itu,  Allah  menimbulkan  rasa penyesalan  yang  sangat  di  dalam  hati  mereka.  Allah  menghidupkan  dan  mematikan.  Dan Allah melihat apa yang kamu kerjakan.  Dan sungguh kalau kamu gugur di jalan  Allah  atau  meninggal tentulah ampunan  Allah  dan  rahmat-Nya  lebih  baik  (bagimu) dan harta rampsan yang mereka kumpulkan.  Dan sungguh jika kamu meninggal atau gugur, tentulah kepada Allah saja kamu dikumpulkan.  Maksudnya:  meninggal  di  jalan  Allah  bukan karena peperangan.  Maka  disebabkan  rahmat  dari  Allah-lah  kamu  berlaku  lemah lembut  terhadap  mereka.  Sekiranya  kamu  besikap  keras  lagi  berhati  kasar,  tentulah  mereka menjauhkan diri dari sekelilingmu, Karena  itu  ma'afkanlah  mereka,  mohonkanlah ampun bagi mereka, dan bermusyawarahlah  dengan mereka  dalam  urusan  itu.  Kemudian  apabila  kamu  telah  membulatkan  tekad,  maka  bertawakkallah  kepada Allah.  Sesungguhnya  Allah  menyukai  orang-orang yang  bertawakkal kepada-Nya.  Jika Allah menolong kamu, maka mengalahkan  kamu;  Jika  Allah membiarkan kamu (tidak memberi pertolongan)   maka siapakah gerangan  yang  dapat  menolong kamu (selain) dari Allah sesudah itu?  Karena  itu  hendaklah  kepada  Allah  saja  orang-orang  mu'min bertawakkal.  Tidak  mungkin  seorang  nabi  berkhianat  (dalam  urusan rampasan  perang).  Barangsiapa yang berkhianat  (dalam urusan rampasan perang itu),  maka pada hari  Kiamat  ia  akan  datang membawa apa yang dikhianatkannya itu; Kemudian tiap-tiap diri akan diberi pembalsan tentang apa  yang   ia kerjakan     dengan   (pembalasan)  setimpal,  sedang  mereka tidak dianiaya.  Apakah  orang  yang  mengikuti keridaan  Allah  sama dengan orang yang kembali  membawa  kemurkaan (yang besar) dari  Allah dan tempatnya adalah Jahannam? . Dan itulah  seburuk-buruk  tempat  kembali.  (Kedudukan)     mereka    itu   bertingkat-tingkat  di sisi  Allah, dan  Allah  Maha  Melihat  apa  yang  mereka  kerjakan.  Sungguh  Allah  telah  memberi karunia kepada orang-orang yang beriman ketika  Allah mengutus di antara mereka seorang rasul dari golongan  mereka sendiri,  yang membacakan kepada mereka ayat-ayat Allah,  membersihkan (jiwa) mereka, dan mengajarkan kepada mereka  Al  Kitab dan Al  Hikmah.  Dan  sesungguhnya  sebelum  (kedatangan  Nabi) itu,  mereka adalah    benar-benar  dalam kesesatan yang nyata.  Bersambung  Terimakasih sampurasun Wabil taufik walhidayah.

I do not have to build a lot of wealth if we really need money, I better vote for what is fulfilled in the promise and stand for truth and promise. We know that many people need something now but we need to vote for the strong, even if he is not rich as long as he did the right thing and knows how to fulfill that vote. So if I am among you citizens I will choose to vote because it is up to them who they will vote for.  Trump: Like Biden: Like It’s up to you if you want to comment  By: Sophia Leafar V.

The biggest joke is US healthcare (regardless of president). And the joke's on the people. Make healthcare (and all education) free like every civilized country has for decades. It's not normal that someone with, say, cancer should have to pay for the treatment or people have to pay thousands of dollars for insulin or even pay tuition for university... in you own country?! Madness. Socialism may not be the best, but there are things to take from each ideology. Why even pay taxes at all without these basic rights?	-1
Biden's Abraham Lincoln comment will probably be looked at as the moment Trump definitively lost the election	-1
"At 52:11 when Biden says Trump is taking money from other countries Trump can't even keep a straight face because he knows he got caught. He's such a liar about paying ""tens of millions of dollars"" in taxes. A big con artist and a fool. Smh!!"	-1

All tares are sentenced to perdition by the authority of the holy spirit and Creator.  All tares, every last one of you, whenever the Creator wants, instantly, and soon, you will be cast into the abyss. There, you will be in utter darkness, and in a state of total delirium. You'll be confused, nauseous, dizzy, feel painfully sick, and your logic and ability to perceive left from right, up from down, won't work anymore. That's because the grace of the Creator which gave you those abilities will be forever gone at that point, much like your free will already is gone now as you serve the satanic hive mind and are a slave to it. There's no time in perdition, so your time there will never end. There is no where you can go in the abyss, because everywhere you walk melts away or circles back on itself. You'll hear the wailings of other tares in there with you, but you won't be able to find them. Sleep is impossible, so is eating or drinking. And yet you'll feel those urges to do those things just as you did in this world. But they will be impossible.	-1

the White House no longer focused on Otto's tragedy. In fact, it swung so far in the opposite direction that civil-rights groups complained about human-rights issues not being on the agenda for the summit in Singapore. When the three remaining American detainees were released in May, Trump welcomed them home by saying, “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.”  this is what he said, even knowing how south Korea Kim Ong-un tortured and made  like a vegetable  a yuong man of 21 named Otto Warmbie until he died. This is the saddest xtory I ever read. Google it and find out.   Trump is a traitor to out country.	-1

A SCOUNDREL, NUMBNUTS IS A LYING, FOOLISH, AND A FLIGHTY CREATURE. A SIMPLETON WHO CARES FOR NOTHING AND NO ONE BUT HIMSELF. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TREATING US AS CATTLE? ARE WE NOTHING BUT BRUTE BEAST TO YOU? IS THE EARTH A DESERT TO PROVE YOU RIGHT? WHEN A FOOL SPEAKS RUIN IS NEAR. LEWDNESS AND TARDINESS IS SPORT FOR THE STUPID. A GODLESS MAN WHO NEVER LISTENS TO CORRECTION. HATE IS ALWAYS PICKING A QUARREL. BY HIS WORDS THIS GODLESS MAN HAS RUINED MANY OTHERS. LIKE A GOLD RING IN A PIGS`S SNOUT THIS RICH MAN IS WITHOUT COMMON SENSE OR CHARACTER. A CRUEL MAN WHO MAKES TROUBLE, HAS NO RESPECT FOR HIS NEIGHBORS. WHOEVER RELIES ON HIS WEALTH AND PURSUES EVIL IS RIDING FOR A FALL. A MAN IS COMMENDED FOR HIS INTELLIGENCE, BUT A WRAPPED AND CONCEITED MIND IS DESPISED. THIS FOOL THINKS HE IS ALWAYS RIGHT: THEREFORE IS ALWAYS TRAPPED BY HIS OWN FALSEHOODS. DO HE KNOW TRUTH STANDS FIRM FOREVER, BUT LIES LIVE ONLY FOR A MOMENT. A CLEVER MAN CONCEALS HIS KNOWLEDGE, BUT A FOOLISH AND STUPID MAN BROADCAST AND PARADES HIS FOLLY. VIOLENCE IS MEAT AND DRINK FOR THE TREACHEROUS. A BRAINLESS FOOL CAUSES STRIFE BY HIS PRESUMPTIONS. ILL FORTUNE FOLLOWS A SINNER CLOSE BEHIND, MIXED WITH STUPIDITY AND TELLING A PACK OF LIES WILL LEAD TO DISASTER. FOLLY IS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ORNAMENT OF THE STUPID. THIS MADNESS MAY AMUSE THE EMPTY-HEADED: BUT SCHEMES LIGHTLY MADE COMES TO NOTHING! A BAD TEMPER PROVOKE QUARRELS. BETTER A DISH OF VEGETABLES IF LOVE GO WITH IT THAN A FAT OX EATEN IN HATRED. THE ROAD OF THE INTELLIGENCE DILIGENT IS A HIGHWAY, A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING MAKES STRAIGHT FOR HIS GOALS. A SCOUNDREL REPEATS EVIL GOSSIP (CRYING ABOUT A WALL THAT NO ONE WANTS); IT IS LIKE A SCORCHING FIRE ON HIS LIPS. FINE TALK IS OUT OF PLACE FOR THIS BOOR, BETTER FACE A SHE-BOOR ROBBED OF HER CUBS THAN A STUPID MAN IN HIS FOLLY! WHAT USE IS MONEY IN THE HANDS OF A STUPID MAN? CAN HE BUY WISDOM IF HE HAS NO SENSE? EVEN A FOOL, IF HE HOLDS HIS PEACE IS THOUGHT WISE. PRACTICE IN EVIL MAKES PERFECT THIS SCOUNDREL. THE ONE WHO UTTERS NOTHING BUT LIES WILL NOT GO FREE. THIS FOOL TRAITOR AT THE HELM IS OUT OF PLACE. BETTER TO BE A POOR MAN THAN A LIAR. THERE IS A ROD IN PICKLE FOR THE ARROGANT, AND BLOWS READY FOR THE STUPID MAN`S BACK!!! THE MAN WHO SOWS INJUSTICE REAPS TROUBLE, THE END OF HIS WORK WILL BE THE ROD!!! THE LORD KEEPS WATCH OVER EVERY CLAIM AT LAW AND WILL OVERTURN THIS SCOUNDREL'S CASE. THERE IS A LION AND A DEEP PIT OUTSIDE. THOSE WHOM THE LORD HAS CURSED WILL FALL INTO IN. A TYRANT OPPRESS THE POOR; THE LAWLESS PRAISE THE WICKED MEN; THE LAW-ABIDING IS ABOUT TO CONTEND WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE SHOULD BE A SHAME OF HIMSELF, AND ON THE WAY TO RUSSIA! THE NEW YORK CROWBAR HOTEL IS NEXT!	-1
Mr President, your no Abe Lincoln	-1
Interesting and very Insightful!!.. I have a heartbreaking story to share on how I got out of Jail and became rich. Sometime June 2017, I had a business deal worth millions of dollars with some people including my best friend which lasted for 7months and it eventually pulled through. Everyone became happy and we needed to celebrate our victory, Unknowingly to me, that they were not happy because i have a higher percentage share of the money, greed had set in. They all had a plan to frame me up with a murder case so they could share the money amongst themselves. I got arrested, tried and convicted, my best friend was part of this plan. my family and business suffered a great deal while i was in jail. My family did all they could to get me out of jail to no avail. Until my wife read about a spell caster/ cure expert named Olalekan, she then contacted him and told him about me and he promised to help, eventually I got out of jail 17th November 2019. Then my wife told me about him and I contacted and told him everything that had happened and he said i shouldn't worry that i'm going to get back all I have lost, that I should file a lawsuit against them even though i do not stand a chance of winning the case. I believed in Olalekan and to my greatest surprise I won the lawsuit and got all i had lost. Also, the murder case was revisited and they were found guilty and all sentenced to jail, I'm internally grateful to Olalekan. You can reach Dr. Olalekan on whatsapp; +2349050071327 or email at: Olalekanspell@gmail.com .	-1

That man is gonna make the US worse than EU. That climate lie is a business, its quite clear.

Run farmers of their land to fill fields with solar panels that only last for so long and then where u gonna dump them, wind turbines that destroy the whole ecoystem their put in and electric cars with cobalt in the batteries fueled by slave labour in the 3rd world. Biden voters are going to get the facist state they asked for. He laughed it off when Trump said the thing about wind turbines killing birds because the birds are such a small price to pay for a globalist like Biden.	-1

@49:28 Joe's reaction screams CAUGHT!!	108
I'm not an American, I come from Germany but spent 10 months of my life in Wisconsin as an exchange student when I was 16, so the USA had a great impact on my life and have helped define me in a way. Please don't talk as if the result was already there with Biden's presidency as given fact. Nobody believed Trump would win the first time and this time is no different. Celebrating too early and raising high hopes for those who eagerly await Biden as the next president can lead to enormous disillusionment and frustration on the democratic side if the opposite of what you believe turns out to be true. You simply cannot be so sure and your country at this point is no longer the United States, you're the Divided States with radicalisation taking place on either side - republican and democratic. There are news reports here in Germany, like a YT channel called Epoch Times for example, that despite being questionable supposedly has presented a lot of evidence towards voter fraud. NOTHING IS DECIDED YET, at this point TRUMP IS STILL PRESIDENT and the way I see him, it would make perfect sense for him to present evidence towards fraud in the very last moment and repeat his phrases about FAKE NEWS, rubbing it in all the democrats faces that it was a big mistake not to trust his words and you know it would only be his right to do so! If at this point there is a vast majority of Americans who honestly don't mind who it's going to be on Dec. 14th there is no reason to act now, then it's just fine. But if a majority of you, Trump supporters AND Biden supporters are truly concerned with the possibility of a civil war breaking loose if things turn out not how it appears now, maybe you should all get together and PROTEST AGAINST BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES IN UNITY. Agreement on what you absolutely DON'T WANT, which is CIVIL WAR could offer both sides enough common ground to take this chance! Do you really need Biden to tell you what you now need the most is UNITY ? And how convincing will that sound to Trump supporters, even though it's ABSOLUTELY TRUE ? But also you should really be able to see it yourself! It's in the name of your country for god sake! Act now and protest to reject both of them in UNITY !	-1

Olá eu sou 'Marcelo Pear e eu sou do Rio Brasil. Deixe-me testemunhar perante o público sobre um grande médico fitoterápico chamado dr wise of africa que me ajudou com minha própria doença. Eu tinha HIV / AIDS há mais de 5 anos e estava quase no fim da minha vida por causa da aparência da minha pele. Tudo o que tenho na cabeça é desistir, porque a vida não me interessa mais. Uma noite, minha irmã me disse que havia encontrado um médico na internet que poderia curar o HIV / AIDS. Não me interessou porque não acreditei. Ela me ajudou com tudo o que o médico pediu, preencheu a ficha de tratamento para mim e até usou seu próprio dinheiro para conseguir o remédio para mim. Durante uma semana de uso da droga comecei a ficar mais forte, meu sangue começou a fluir normalmente 4 a 7 dias depois, comecei a engordar, antes da 2ª semana meu corpo começou a se desenvolver, minha pele começou a crescer. Depois de um mês, fiz o teste de HIV e testei negativo. Estou muito feliz em poder dizer que não sou mais um paciente com HIV / AIDS. Se você tem HIV / AIDS, hepatite, herpes ou HPV, doença coronariana ou qualquer outra doença, entre em contato com o Dr. WISE. Seu telefone +2349063191711 e seu número do Whatsapp é: +2349063191711. Desejo-lhe boa sorte, Deus abençoe a todos. Você também pode ligar para +2349063191711	-1

On the right and bottom, if a government suspected of corruption cheats its vote on the leader of the country, America will no longer have the number one position in the world, so the American people and officials have to clarify. This case of corruption and fraudulent vote, this is a very important thing to choose a leader of the United States, the American people, whom the allies believe in not for their own interests but neglect. America is the leading country in civilization, the number one great power, should be an example, so it must make this incident clearer.	-1

"Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said after the US election that Kiev can get serious support from Joe Biden. Kostya Bondarenko is convinced that the former Ukrainian leader does not understand the essence of the issue. ... According to the expert, Poroshenko hopes that Biden in the presidential chair will remember the former friendly relations and support him. But it is better for the elected head of the White house not to touch the Ukrainian topic. ""Forget about words like Ukraine, Burisma, the hunter Biden scandal, and so on,"" Bondarenko said. We are talking about the corruption scandal surrounding the Ukrainian private oil and gas company Burisma. Biden's son hunter was on the company's Board of Directors. The newly elected us President Joe Biden is a native of the Ukrainian nobility, said Valery bebik, a Professor of political science at the national University of Ukraine. ""Few people know that Joe Biden is a distant descendant of the founder of the Zaporozhye Sich Vishnevetsky-Bayda. It was his great-great-great-grandfather-a London banker-who was given the gold of polubotka for safekeeping, thanks to which the United States of America rose,"" bebik said in the Ukrainian media. ""Gold polubotka"" - a popular pseudo-historical myth in Ukraine about how the ""Jewish plutocracy"" in the XVIII robbed Ukrainians."	-1

The story of how Biden and Poroshenko for a billion dollars from Joe Biden fired the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, who began to investigate the son of Joe Biden, hunter Biden, the youngest son of us Vice President Joe Biden, became a member of the Board of Directors of Burisma in April 2014 (it also included former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, a friend of the stepson of former Secretary of state John Kerry Devon Archer, and others). ... As part of the investigation into possible money laundering, the British authorities froze deposits in London banks for $23 million, which allegedly belonged to the owner of Burisma Zlochevsky. In Ukraine, a new scandal, and surprisingly not coronavirus. This week, the world finally saw and heard the documentary ... We found out who exactly and what Poroshenko paid a billion dollars for-this is Joe Biden and the entire Obama army. There are prospects for increasing gas production in Ukraine — but this issue depends on the normalization of the investment climate in the country and the availability of the necessary funds, says Mikhail Krutikhin, senior analyst at Rusenergy. In his opinion, at a distance of about 10 years, Kiev can replace the volume of transit (or the volume of gas that is currently supplied to the country from European countries) with its own production. ... But after Joe Biden's frequent visits to Kiev and his statements about the corruption of the Prosecutor General, the need to rid Ukraine of dependence on Russian gas and the development of the shelf with the help of the Americans, the case was closed against Joe Biden's son hunter Biden.	-1
Trump is good. Prove me wrong.	-1
Also FYI the only reason Biden went and declared himself the winner before the election was over and democrats preasure media to announce it despite Biden saying before the election that he would not declare or accept the win until ALL THE VOTES WERE COUNTED and the only reason he went back on it and declared himself the winner was to make it impossible to reverse without triggering mass riots across the nation they did it simply to once again as they do often use the media to convince you his supporters that he had won when the votes were still being counted so that in the event he lost in the end or that trump tried to fight it or investigate it that you his supporters would trash the country because you will have believed he had won and it was being stolen from you	-1
My God how fúcking stupid the democrats must think the ppl who voted for him are and they are stupid and of course they are the ones committing the violence trump hopes for according to this story. But seriously folks do you honestly believe 1 that trump wants violence he has spoken out about the riots offering to help the DEMOCRAT RUN CITIES where all the violence was during every DEMOCRAT PROTESTS and was refused in favor of just letting them burn the cities down trump was the only one calling for an end to the violence or how about the deplorable trump supporters who PEACEFULLY PROTESTED the fact they believe that democrats cheated with very strong proof they have cheated and stole the election surpressing the will of 74 mlion Americans and who they voted for and fear that this loss will be more than the loss of a an election but the loss of freedom and democracy yet they were still able to peacefully protest and show their support for trumps fight for a fair election. Atleast until the democrat protesters showed up and started beating ppl families with women and children being assaulted with bat's bike chains with pad locks and large explosive fireworks stealing anything that fell to the ground from the attacks on them and no democrat has ever denounced or called for peace infact all they do is incite violence point fingers lay blame make up lies to get their way so I ask again do you ppl who support this man and the democratic party seriously believe that trump Is the one dividing the country and wants the violence. The only thing trump wants is the truth and a fair election you would think that democrats would want the same thing what's the harm if there was nothing to worry about if the voting is so secure and there is as they claim 0 evidence of voter fraud then what do they have to lose by doing an audit of the election so that everyone can see and feel confident that nothing was fraudulent and Biden could then peacefully take over as president with the backing of the whole country rather than have 74 million ppl who think you stole it. The only reason you wouldn't want to look at it is if you knew that it wasn't fair and ask yourselves this all you ppl who support democrats who were willing without hesitation to fabricate the Russian collusion which was proven to be made up and who impeached trump for the crime of trying to do what he promised as a campaign promise to his voters to look into tackling corruption and they impeached him for it. We all know they only impeached trump to the stop him from looking into it because they already knew it was a problem and they knew if trump looked he'd find what he was looking for so they impeached him but ask yourselves. If democrats were so upset as to harras trump every day for 4 years refusing to work with him or to even recognize him as the president then you would think in 2016 with such a close race for Hillary why didn't she then put up more of a fight she just gave up she lost but such a small number that any recount could have turned it for her why didn't they fight like at all just gave up and dissapears from public view............. Because she knew then that they cheated in that election too and had they gone back and looked closer in a recount that it might expose what they did that's why Hillary gave up without a fight the level of hatred they had for trump and the abdoute 100% for sure they thought no way in hell trump would win then he wins by like 45 votes and she just walks away come on ppl wake up and smell the coffee please and then let's come together to take this chance we have cause we may never get another to tackle corruption...... Corruption on both sides that trump is on the outside of no matter what you think of trump I promise you whether he was in on corruption in his past or not he is not on their side repuicans dislike him as much as democrats do because trump seeks to end their grasp on power let's help him to help ourselves and I'm not saying trump is a hero he's the antihero trump didn't come into office planning to be the ppl's champion he fell into it because the elites wouldn't let trump into their club so trump said fine fúck you then and became the ppl's champ simply because he wants to make them pay for excluding him but it just happens to work for our benifit who cares how he got there let's help him help us cause I promise when trump is gone and we're back to having to choose between 2 corrupt politicians that nothing will be done for the ppl again and this time they will make sure another wild card like trump never throws another monkey wrench in the plan again	-1

"First Question 2 - Minute Answer Rounded Out: (I hope this helps because I know some of you don't wanna watch the first part)    Question: How would you lead the country in the next stage of the coronavirus pandemic?    Trump, 26:29 : 1 minute and a half minutes in: Trump has just finished talking about what the US and the world is dealing with, saying he has taken care of it with masks, goggles, and gowns (aka literally the obvious way to treat the coronavirus)  1 minute in: Trump talks about how he has recovered from the coronavirus and how he is immune to it  Last 30 seconds: Trump saying how the coronavirus may soon end because of 'what he has done' (Not explained) and that he's 'rounding the turn and rounding the corner'. ""It's going away,"" Trump says.    Biden, 28:38 :  Abut 30 seconds in: Biden talks about how anyone who doesn't take responsibility for xxx deaths (forgot the number) should not be president. Hinting that Trump is saying that he isn't taking any responsibility for the millions of deaths worldwide.  40 seconds in: Biden discusses information on the coronavirus and uses a reference from an important source. He also talks about how the president (Donald Trump) still has no plan on what to do.   Rest of the 2-minute speech: Biden actually talks about what he will do as a president;  He says he will make sure everyone wears a mask all the time and other examples of what he will do. He also includes that the way Donald Trump is handling this is 'absolutely tragic', also quoted from an important source.  ""I will make sure to end this, I will make sure to have a plan,"" Biden says.    And guys sorry if this looks long and boring and you'd rather watch the debate. I just felt like doing this because I wanted to compare Trump's first answer compared to Biden's so people can see how different they are. I will not give a summary of the rest of the stuff as I am only 12 years old and I am pretending that I'm doing this for homework so my Asian mother does not think I'm watching YouTube.    Also, I don't know if I am the only one who thinks that this is offensive but here you go: 26:39  Quoted: ""...in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China."" - Trump I know it's called being informative but why does it sound like he purposely wants to call China out, you could've just left it there at 'horrible disease'. bruh  If you think otherwise please don't attack me in the replies haha"	-1

Tôi đang bị bọn tội phạm dùng chiếc một chiếc máy  thu phát hình ảnh âm thanh tiếp cận tôi bằng một tần số riêng, chiếc máy này là nguyên nhân gây ra những vụ án giết người hàng loạt do hoan tưởng, đánh cấp tiền ở các ngân hàng và nó cũng chính là nguyên nhân gây ra tham nhũng cho cả thế giới, chức năng chiếc máy này có thể truyền dữ liệu hình ảnh âm thanh qua não bộ người và thu về dữ liệu hình ảnh mà người bị hại suy nghĩ đến , nó có thể giả giọng nói của những người thân quen của nạn nhân. Bọn tội phạm xâm lược dùng để đánh cấp các thông tin bí mật của nạn nhân rồi khống chế buộc họ phải làm việc cho bọn nó. Chiếc máy này thật nguy hiểm nó đang xâm lược tàn phá đất nước tôi, hiện nay đại dịch covid đang tăng sẽ dẫn đến suy thoái kinh tế thế giới, nạn tham nhũng sẽ dẫn đến chiến tranh thế giới.FB Vũ Hoàng của tôi từng đăng bài viết lịch sử 1000 năm bị mất của Việt Nam bọn tội phạm này đã tiếp cận hack đi Facebook , YouTube , số điện thoại của tôi vì tôi đã tìm ra được một số tín năng ưu điểm của chiếc máy này và tính năng mà bọn tội phạm sử dụng chiếc máy này sợ nhất là tín năng sở hữu trí tuệ,phát hiện nói dối và một số tính năng giúp người khác mà tôi từng đăng trên Youtube cho bác Trump nếu trường hợp tôi bị mất tích nếu ai sản xuất ra những chiếc máy có tính năng tương tự mà tôi đã phát minh thì đó là thủ phạm bác Trump có quyền bắt và sở hữu các máy này , tôi nhận thấy bầu có nhiều bất thường nhiều khả năng là do bọn tội phạm dùng chiếc máy này thao túng các quan chức gây ra.Nếu tìm ra được chiếc máy này bác Trump sẽ tìm ra được thủ phạm đằng sau gian lận phiếu bầu , và thủ phạm gieo rắc đại dịch covid ,hiện giờ khi đang viết bài họ vẫn đang tiếp cận tôi bằng tầng số riêng đe doạ tôi . Xin chuyển giúp đến tổng thống Trump .	-1

I can't believe that American people chose Biden as the President <lol> this guy is almost dead, firstly he needs to check his mental and physical fitness	-1
"I'm shocked that people claim to have seen this but are somehow unable to ""see"". Yes, Trump may have made mistakes as a president, but one thing for sure, he's a president that is bringing hope to the American people, the labourers, the common people. Meanwhile, Joe is here spelling doom and gloom while having major corporate funding (and then some). How can anyone want the senile warmonger over the self-depreciating orange man who's stopped more wars in American history since, freaking forever?"	-1

For me the Trump should win because I live in Serbia and he didn't do anything wrong to us he even helped us. But Biden is better for America but he isn't better for us because he sand 500! Planes in 90's to our country to destroy it... Because Kosovo didn't wanted to confirm tham self as a country so he destroyed street on my country.	-1

Trump said we need to open the country because of the suicides, abuse, loss of jobs, drug abuse, are higher than ever before. Why the fuck do you think that is? It's because you failed to let your nation isolate for even a single month, it was as simple as that. Covid is what is causing all of this, children are losing their parents and commiting suicide, because you say masks and social distancing aren't effective, then look where that led.	-1

I like trump hes like a kid😍👿	-1
There is no way Biden would have been able to win the election if he weren't against Trump. Trump is saying virtually nothing in this debate, repeating shallow words with little meaning, like a senile old man. Biden is doing the same thing on a smaller scale, saying virtually nothing and shallowly attacking Trump. Biden won because of how terrible Trump's administration handled the covid situation, and Biden has not shown that he'll be able to handle it better than him. God help us all.	-1
Kristen Walker was a better debate moderator than both Chris Wallace and Susan Page.	-1

Re-elected by Trump Court ruling. Just watch. Almighty God said that he was electing Trump. If you just re-elect Trump, their evils won't come out. You allow these things. It is a plan to bring the evils of the Democratic Party and the media to the surface. Trust me. I will see it clearly.  트럼프 법원 판결로 재선 됩니다. 그냥 지켜보시면 됩니다. 전능하신 하나님께서 트럼프를 당선 시킨다고 말씀 하셨습니다. 트럼프를 그냥 재선 시키면 저들의 악들이 들어나지 않기에 이런 일들을 허락하시는 겁니다. 민주당과 언론들의 악들을 수면위로 만천하에 드려 내시려는 계획이시구요. 믿으십쇼. 여러분들 두 눈으로!!!  똑똑히 볼 것입니다.	-1

Firefighters, Police officers emergency responders , Doctors and nurses should have there Utilities such as electricity, water, gas, phone  and Internet service provided for free. Also they should be provided a monthly voucher for fresh produce. This would be a large benefit to those essential workers. And would relieve much stress from the lives of the people that are dedicated to serving others. This is just one plan that could benefit The United States. Put this in place and then create more programs to help integrate the young generation into society and into jobs/careers.	-1

What they should have done is get rid of taxes give each and every American an entire year salary to stay home make sure that each American is getting utilities and sufficient funds they need to live and let those with the virus recover and reboot the economy and have a hold off payment on foerghn debt holders so we can fix the world instead of spending much more trying to fix an ongoing problem that costs way more than that plan.	-1

لم يكن فيروس نقص المناعة البشرية / الإيدز أمرًا سهلاً ولكن مع مرور الوقت ، تعاملت ببطء مع حالة فيروس نقص المناعة البشرية / الإيدز وحالتي وأحاول التعامل معها بموقف إيجابي. في منتصف عام 2018 مرضت بشدة. لقد أصبت بأعراض تشبه أعراض الأنفلونزا ، والصداع ، والسعال المزعج ، والقروح التي لا تشفى. شعرت وكأن بشرتي تزحف ، وألمت ساقاي ، وشعرت بالغثيان وفقدان الوزن. ثم ضرب الإرهاق. لقد كان تعبًا لا يوصف ، وبغض النظر عن مقدار نومي ، لم أشعر أبدًا بالراحة. في عام 201 ، دخلت المستشفى عندما انخفض عدد CD4 إلى 86 (التهاب الكبد B ، الأشخاص السلبيون لديهم عدد CD4 بين 700 و 1000 ؛ يعتبر عدد CD4 أقل من 200 منخفضًا بشكل خطير). كان الوقت العصيب. هناك الكثير لأقوله عن الدكتور أورال ولكن لا يمكنني ذكر سوى القليل في الوقت الحالي ، هذا الرجل رائع جدًا وجيد وقوي. دكتور أورال ، كل الشكر له على إعطائي فرصة ثانية ، إذا كنت هناك تمر بأي مشكلة ، يمكنك الاتصال به اليوم على بريده الإلكتروني عبر: droralherbalremedies@gmail.com أو ما الذي سببه الآن على +2348071332427) وانا اعلم انه سيساعدك ايضا. اتصل به لأي نوع من الأمراض أدناه مثل: 1 الغاء 2 الإيدز 3 التهاب الكبد سي 4 ـ علاج الصدفية 5 الهربس 6 فيروس الورم الحليمي البشري 7 مرض السيلان 8 STI (العدوى المنقولة جنسياً) 9 STD (الأمراض المنقولة جنسيا) 10 السكتة الدماغية.	-1
If you gonna wear the mask, stop take it down and put it back and take it down then put it back...sitting eating in a restaurant with so many people and took mask down the put it back..that’s dirty af....I would rather not wearing anything than that. Lots of companies is shutdown in Sweden, that’s led me to lose my job.. and tons of others. Luckily I can still get support from my parents and my boyfriend, but many people doesn’t have this opportunity.  Biden’s strategy is just bull shit, he never thinks about normal working people, where the money from. I can’t believe some of the Americans letting this guy to do so.. when you lose your job and need money, how will you live? If no one is working where can you get the food, electric, water, money or anything??	37

The mere fact that he has trouble with his speech makes me doubt him as a politian much more as a president, I think he is too old to run.    Plus, is this a debate? All of it is some info, nothing too concrete, and the rest is both of them trying to hurt each other, how can the american people not do anything about this ?	-1

"JOHN F. KENNEDY:  “I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute - where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote - where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference - and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him.I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish - where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source - where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials - and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all"".

"Funny that biden refers to other leaders as thugs but he doesnt mention recep tayyip erdogan turkeys leader, why is that mr biden? thug dictators are bad only when they aint US allies?  Africa doesnt have thug dictator leaders? Why US dont run there to ""free"" people from them? You cant point the finger to thug dictators  that arent working for the US and caress thug dictators that work for american interests. See all people equally and dont devide the world according to american interests and then ur country would be a land of dreams yes. For now the motto around the world is that when the US gained their independance the rest of the world lost his."	-1

I must be one of the few who don’t have trouble showing and telling someone how grateful I am for making my Relationship a melodious and smooth Relationship. I have been trying to be more positive about my relationship with my wife, it seems like it has taken forever. Another man took My wife away from me and they both relocated. I cried and searched for him to come back but he refused to take my calls nor return my messages. My friend introduced me to a powerful spell caster called Dr osusu who helped me cast a very powerful love spell that brought back my wife in 24 hours. I was amazed and surprised when my wife called to beg me for forgiveness all because of the powerful love spell of Dr osusu . Don""t fail to Contact Dr osusu through the following means if you have any Marital or Relationship problem.contact him on  Email: drosususolution@gmail.com..........."	-1

Where is the democracy in our country . Look how many balloted where found in Arizona unopened and so many in other states specially Nevada the BIGEST crooked state in the United States where there is no law you are the law . Each citizen is the law as the system is so corrupted a lady steps out and says she never voted her ballot was stolen and someone voted for her along with other people and many other states . I agree with president Trump but again our court houses are corrupted nothing is going right I bet you there are thousands of people serving years sentences in jail and they are innocent look how many Illegal Mexicans voting and they have no papers what so ever . And you guys saying democracy . This election belongs to Trump not to sleepy Biden that did fraud along with his son Hunter and what’s so funny the democrats allowed him to go to presidency when he used the tax payers plane and the time of the tax payers do him son becomes a ceo and gets Millions of dollars 💵 Hunter along with Joe Biden should be serving a life time in a county jail in Alaska so there asses freeze 🥶 but look what a corrupted country is the USA 🇺🇸. A new low should be unforced that any one wants to be elected to the president of the USA should be between 65-67 max Biden is 77 and his brains are missing a lots of screws besides the once that are lose .

Open Letter To The 45th President Of The United States Of America Donald J Trump  God Bless You Donald Trump and give you the courage, strength and wisdom, to be on the right side of destiny, to be the greatest president the USA has ever had!!  Sir you have achieved more in your 1st term in office than all the previous presidents combined.  Once people realise and really wake up, and see your hand in the down fall of the cabal, the global elites, the corrupt bankers, mainstream media,politicians, the various royal families in the world and their insatiable thirst for adrenochrome and other nefarious activities.  To gain the fountain of youth they have needlessly enslaved young children and trafficked them like disposable goods. All In the pursuit of their own insatiable greed & vanity, they have sacrificed their humanity and are pure evil and satanic to the core.  Once people realise your great military war against the deep state, and all the 5 million children that you have rescued from dumbs (deep underground military bases). You will become a national & international hero. Posterity will confirm and history will record. That You Sir, will be remembered as the Greatest President of The USA. Who has actually given the power back to the people, aswell as their liberty & freedoms. May the sun always shine, on the glorious New Republic, that you have newly created, once the US goes back to constitutional law and away from corrupt marine law.  Most importantly though Sir you will be remembered as the greatest peace maker and humanitarian.  I can only reiterate that Donald you are an amazing man and inspirational in your vision. I can only wish you a very long live, aswell as your incredible family.  God bless the USA and the rest of the world. MAGA!!!	-1
Trump has been telling that he will declare tax ....for a how many years now????	-1

I never supported Biden (nor Trump), but Trump was awful at this debate (and the first one). He only spoke about himself, about how good he has done his work (in everything he was asked), about how not-racist-at-all he is, about how Joe Biden is this way and he didn't do anything while he was VP for 8 years. He said he’s besties with Kim Jong-Un, that he loves black people and accused personally Biden for everything that “Obama did” or didn't do while president. Trump also expressed his love for clear air, immigrants, clear water and for a “non-democratic” country. In this debate and the other one, he talked about his personal self and the personal life of his opponent, not focusing on what does the country need, what do the citizens need and want; and, most importantly, he didn’t respond to which possible improvements he would bring to the country if he were elected again.  Basically, he lost (by far) because he doesn’t seem to look further than him, and because he thinks that these debates are actually kids’ fights.	-1

I am saying this good news to the hearing of the universe because i won the texas lottery last week. I have been in the street of Texas with nothing in my pocket and totally financially down, i meant an old college friend of mine called John and he was so rich and i wonder how he make all this money in such a short time. We had a drink together and he introduced me to a priest from Africa and tell me that he is the secret to riches and surely i contacted this temple and i tell him i want to win texas lottery and he told me the requirement which i provided and he cast a spell and gave me the numbers to play after 3 days. I was so surprised when i won $300,000.00 USD and i was so grateful i never believe it will work but it was like a miracle that this man made me rich. I am a living testimony and i advise everyone who need help to email him through templeofpermanenthealings @gmail.com or whatsapp him through +2348163083041	-1

"Trump is not lying, is talking about concrete things about Biden and Biden is just smiling and saying ""no"" or ""that's not me that's you"". Biden is talking for people who don't like to think and to find the truth."	-1
Trump is world most funnier president	-1
La solución nunca debe ser peor que el problema. Si la solución es peor que el problema, es mejor dejar el problema y trabajar en mejorar nuestro status, con una economía fuerte y una vida social saludable será posible vencer el problema.	-1
"Biden.."" not too many of you are going to die""..."	262

we need to see that trump is right in almost everything he said... america has to keep working. biden speech is very emotional or looks like. but we cant be emotionally controlled in this situations. today people die of corona virus if america stop tomorrow people will die of hunger... biden ideias r not good for small buisness a lot of the small buisness will die becouse they cant follow the rules they dont have money for it and they werent prepared for this if they close everything the country will become a desaster. we need to think about the big buisness the small buisness the people and how to controll the virus and we have to get ways to do it all at the same time. corona wont kill more then the hunger if they close everything. and i want to close my commetn saying that i think trump was a jerk a lot o times but here without trying to defend him he has a lot of reazon in what he said.	-1
Thanks America for giving the world a good laugh for the past two weeks :)	-1
In historical this presidential none of them can’t run this country for good	-1

Btw lots of respect for the moderating woman, she's like handling two presidents at once. That's gotta be nerve wrecking, but she stood her authority	-1
I do support Biden generally, as is my right to, however, isn't it so, that what he proposed to do in regards to the Nuclear Arming of North Korea, is escalation and therefore more dangerous?	-1
Please just shut up Donald to much lies.	-1
Are you serious Do ald? You didn't know that you prepayed taxes? Liar in 10 years you payed 750 dollars avoiding to invest in America and you payed huge salary to your children to have a luxyurios life. You can't fool me. You used the profit to reinvest in proprieties for yourself, declaring that your business are on zero. You really think we cant see your dirty job.	-1

Americans all world is thankful to you that you choose Biden. He did so much for my country Bosnia when he did not have any benefit from it. I believe you make the right choice not just for America, but for all of humanity. Long live Biden. Love from Bosnia. 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7eodYCjqp8	-1
"Crazy things Joe said.... How about “I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over make sure she puts, for a traffic stop, put both hands on top of the wheel and don't reach for the glove box because someone might shoot you,” Really?  I am a middle aged white woman and my parents had the ""talk"" with me when I got my driver's license in the 70's.  Pull over, put your hands clearly visible on the wheel and keep them there, no sudden movements, be polite to the officer and wait for  them to tell you what to do.  All my white friends got the same talk too way back then.  I gave the same talk to my children. It's part of learning how to drive on the street and basic traffic stop procedure. I do not believe Biden did not do the same with his child. What pandering nonsense.  I could be mistaken but isn't it a part of many state  driver's handbooks to cover what driver's should do when pulled over for a traffic stop?"	-1
It reminds me the interview of steven job and bill git	-1

Why asking them all this stupid question and not asking what really affects America, abortion, our rights, the constitution, NSA and CIA spying on all of us the police beating killing us and violating our rights, freedom of speech is not hate speech returning the bible to Americans schools, but instead you turn American focus on stupid things like how much money you made and russia and china like wake up people, this politician are just men pleasers that will say anything to get elected they don't care about you or me.	-1

I STAND FOR TRUMP “Let me be clear. I am not a Biden fan at all. He is corrupt, a liar, suffering from dementia. He has done nothing to improve anything in 47/48 years in politics.  I truly believe Biden is just the stepping stone for Kamala Harris to take over the White House. Nancy Pelosi is already trying to put a 25th amendment in place to remove an unfit president. I don’t believe that has a thing to do with Trump having Covid. I think that’s to remove Biden if elected for dementia and Harris to take over.  This is my opinion so don’t bother to bash it, I haven’t bashed yours. The clown in the White House just brokered two Middle East Peace Accords, something that 71 years of political intervention and endless war failed to produce. The buffoon in the White House is the first president that has not engaged us in a foreign war since Eisenhower. The clown in the White House has had the greatest impact on the economy, bringing jobs, and lowering unemployment to the Black and Latino population of ANY other president. Ever. The buffoon in the White House has exposed the deep, widespread, and long-standing corruption in the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and the Republican and Democratic parties. The buffoon in the White House turned NATO around and had them start paying their dues. The clown in the White House turned our relationship with the Chinese around, brought hundreds of business back to the US, and revived the economy. Hello!!!!!!! The clown in the White House has accomplished the appointing of three Supreme Court Justices and close to 300 Federal Judges. This same clown in the White House lowered your taxes, increased the standard deduction on your IRS return from $12,500 for Married Filing Joint to $24,400  and caused your stock market to move to record levels over 100 times, positively impacting the retirements of tens of millions of citizens. The clown in the White House fast-tracked the development of a COVID Vaccine - it will be available within weeks - we still don't have a vaccine for SARS, Bird Flu, Ebola, or a host of diseases that arose during previous administrations. The clown in the White House rebuilt our military which the Obama administration had crippled and had fired 214 key generals and admirals in his first year of office. This clown in the White House uncovered widespread pedophilia in the government and in Hollywood, and is exposing world wide sex trafficking of minors and bringing children home to their families. The clown in the White House works for free - and he's done all of this and much more in the face of relentless undermining and opposition from people who are threatened because they know they are going to be exposed as the criminals that they are if he is re-elected. I got it, you don't like him. Many of you utterly hate and despise him. How special of you. He is serving you and ALL the American people. What are you doing besides calling him names and laughing about him catching the China virus ????? And please educate me again as to what Biden has accomplished for America in his 47 years in office? I’ll take a ‘clown’ any day versus a fork tongued, smooth talking hypocritical corrupt liar. Please let it be known, I am not sure I would want to have a beer with him (if he drank, which he doesn't) or even be his friend. I don’t care if I even like him. I want a strong leader who isn’t afraid to kick some ass when needed. I don’t need a fatherly figure - I already have one. I don’t need a liar - that's what Hollywood and CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS and the New York Times are for. I don’t need someone to help me, but I also don’t want an obstacle or a demented, senile washed-up Swamp Monster. God bless Donald Trump - the most unappreciated President in history.	-1
Is this debate the reason because of which Biden won the election?	-1

"I'm Australian and shocked that this man managed to get nearly 50% of the votes. And you have a 77 year old man that failed in the last three elections to challenge him?  Personally I think New Zealand has the best government in the world, but I can't trade it.  I'm just waiting for the Chinese or Indian financial markets to offer the same volume and liquidity, then I'm out of the fucked-up country that they call themselves ""America"" even though America comprises approx 40 something countries."	-1
I don’t know why Biden said Trump didn’t do anything about the Covid-19, Trump did his best but the US citizen did not so can’t blame on Trump	-1

"All I see is a debate about how to get more money from the taxpayer and to spend it with overpriced things which in future will proof useless..I think that the real reason about covid-19 is to create a desperate situation among people worldwide and an almost economical collapse within the small business specially in  undeveloped countries, get them dependables on debts from IMF and so get to their natural resources. Further on everything will be perfectly legal, ""transparent"" and nobody was ""forced"" to get those funds. I'll call that modern colonialism. An exchange of solid gold for mirrors. We became a generation of functional analphabets and all the politicians around the world no matter if leftists or rightist are playing us like dummies. Mother Democracy is dead brothers and sisters."	-1

Did you know that the OLDEST PERSON in the entire world actually resides in the USA??  No crap, folks!!  In this clip, you can meet 118 year old Mr William Bradley making his vote for Joe Biden.    It is also possible to view the all-eminent, all-powerful Mr Biden ADMITTING Voter Fraud!!  Ah, deary me, this is just getting a little bit 'awkward' is it not??    However, if you are still not entirely convinced; please also then listen to some folks on the ground in those Polling Halls, with LURID STORIES of entirely inappropriate behaviour by 'Sorters' and 'Monitors' alike.    Maybe better to believe what is actually happening on the gound, rather than 'Headline News' from outlets that are almost completely OWNED by a tiny 'Global Elite'.    My constructive advice would be: there is no need anymore to be HOODWINKED further, so, here comes the Youtube clip...    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41R20Hvwwvg      Stevo N. Silver,  (Truth-bringer).	-1
President Donald Trump, you will win the Creator’s permission. Do not be afraid if everyone stands against you. You must lead America or you will collapse. I swear by God they deceived you with the elections, but they cannot laugh at the Creator because he decided to lead America for 4 years again. I warn you, the American people, before disaster strikes your heads.	-1

Okay, pretty much the only point that President Trump (he's still the current president) has made in this entire debate was when he brought up the concern about the $15 an hour minimum wage. Everything else is a joke, particularly when he compares himself to Abraham Lincoln. Hahaha! This man has jokes!	-1

Did anyone else notice she never rushes Biden out of his answer, meanwhile: You have 10 seconds to respond Mr. Trump.  I'm not biased, I'm just calling it like I see it. I'm not saying she did it with every question, but certainly more than once.	-1

47:47 love this part. That's why also Americans did the right choice! And that's also why Putin shut the fuck up after the election. So happy he wins, USA is the leader of the free world, this election, as a french mattered to me. So important that he won that election, in so many ways	-1
The way the some top and talented Youtubers took their time to analyze and observe top influencers character by gathering facts and using intellect to reach a conclusion is the same way we all need to observe these 2 parties. If we did, we’d clearly see the deceit, if this is just entertainment to you, you are indeed being bamboozled. There is so much to learn from the politics going on here in the US. Pay attention, look at all sides and then decide for yourself.	-1
Donald trump; why didn’t you do it with Obama you had 8 years?. Everyone else: WHAT ABOUT YOU DONALD TRUMP YOU HAD THAT TIME PERIOD SO WHY!?.	-1
I clicked to watch a debate. I got a comedy show instead.😆	-1

In Europe they have closed everyone at home, the total dictatorship is in force with scanner checks, totally violating the constitution in the name of health! The masks do not protect against a virus, a virus and much smaller than the holes in the mask, just read it's all public, a regime is used to establish a health dictatorship this is now in Europe! People protest, they don't have money, they don't work, they don't even go out to see their loved ones for months they have been promising falsehoods and for almost a year we have been locked up with restrictions, which violate our constitution which defends the right to freedom where it no longer exists .. People can't even protest quietly. It's a power game they play to enslave the world, and they want to do it in America.	-1
Why it seems to me that trump was afraid of biden?	-1
You tell me!	-1
Biden always laughs when trump talks. Trump does not laugh when Biden talks.  Biden:I’ve played all fallout games,my charisma is maxed out	-1

Trump ❤️💗💕	210
What I think about trump in this debate: It is stupid to hear Donald trumpet talk, when the woman tells that pls answer the question I think trump just doesn't answer anything. Besides, Trump talks about things that he doesn't know is going to happen. What I think about Joe Biden in this debate: Not long ago a member of his family died because of the covid-19 and I can say that he is very worried about other people, he doesn't want other people to have the same experience as him. I also can say that he is very thoughtful and he thinks about what is good to do and not say stupid things like trump the orange did. JOE BIDEN FOR THE WIN!!!!!	-1
bruh. Biden can't hatch a plan if it isn't sealed in a chicken egg. Trump is a lot better.	-1
"38:35 ""He should have instead of being in the sandtrap at his golf course.""  Lmao Biden basically dropped a sneak diss on Trump's golfing skills as well."	-1
What a good movie :) Recommend (Citizen Living in Europe)	-1
No Offence but the way Donald looks and smiles, I'm getting creeps 😖😖😖	-1
why is this so funny	-1
Mister President, be proud of who you are and stop insulted in others. Because what you did is no different from insulting yourself.	-1
Its china fault 😅🤣🤣	-1

One is 74 and the other 77!    With all respect to the elderly! The science has revealed that our brain ages too!   Our mental abilities change throughout life, and later with aging of brain cells and their billions of complex interconnections.  As we age, our movements and reflexes slow and our cognitive abilities decline.  Age hinders attention, the elderly have more difficulty:  paying attention, processing information rapidly and dividing attention effectively! When we are old we tend to be slower in conceptualizing problems and less ready to change strategies when circumstances shift. In a study involving decision-making, approximately one third of older adults did poorly compared to younger adults.  Wouldn’t it be more appropriate and fortunate for a nation to have a president at the peak age of all his cognitive skills?! an age when the brain is working with optimum efficiency?!!!! He can still have the elderly in the senate for a wise advice if needed!  Anyway! I’m not offending any age, we all were babies, and we all will become old!   I just think that ruling a country and decide its future is much more serious than a debate who owns more money or pay less taxes!  They barely can stand up! No energy, no new fresh ideas! No progress! We are forced to choose between retrograde outdated conservatives or laziness encouragers!  It’s sad!	-1
Can I get subscribe?	149
58:21 I accidentally found the meme template I am glad :))	-1
orange has been ejected 🥸	-1
Biden did nothing but attack trump right off the bat, and play off of the bad media image that's been posed on Trump. He himself has no plans either, from what I heard.	-1
Why is trump so greenish in this i'd like to understand how he achieved that	-1
Trump during the whole debate: 👐🏽	-1
Sry but DONALD TRUMP IS A FRIKEN ORANGE	-1

Complimenti a Biden  🥂, Trump ha fallito ,nel difendere gli americani dal covid e soprattutto non era il presidente di tutti gli americani, era contro le minoranze etniche, ispanici e neri americani, troppo razzismo nella politica di Trump, Biden sembra più equilibrato è onesto, un buon presidente ,io credo che così sarà..Biden 🥂	-1
Trump lost election, because a lot of his voters are dead now, because they listened to him and drank desinfectant and didnt wear a mask, because he didnt. I'm sure Biden-voters are a lot more reasonable and yes, a lot more intelligent	-1
Trump's hands talk more than Trump himself does.	-1
Trump is nationalist, joe is globalist But they're both capitalist	-1

To the trump supporters : No, trump doesn’t support lgbtq+ he says he’s very against it . Biden doesn’t care about lgbtq+ marriage so he’s allows it.Trump doesn’t support black people either. You can’t say lgbtq+ rights or black lives matter if you support trump	-1
Надо было с матами разрешить,было б веселее. )))	11
One is a great business man in knowledge in many subjects and is really to respond in seconds when asked an out of the blue question. The other one is a senile grandpa that can't anwser a question without making 10 grammar mistakes after preparing for it for half a year. It's beyond crazy how this joke of a candidate can actually become president.	-1
"""There is no one harder on Russia than Donald Trump!""  ""I don't take money from China - you do.""  :D :D :D Can't stop laughing.   Thank God, Trumps time is almost over! Yesterday was the best day of 2020."	-1

Trump should start a reality show it better than policy	-1
Why Trump just simply didnt write a law thet he would be as President longer iso these debates etc?	-1
I cannot help but notice that trump's answer was vague, truly elaborated, exaggerated and making the other person look bad cause he feels this is his last chance to convince people to vote for him.	-1
They say they did Biden hole, you think there is also a video of this event.	-1
Mẹ ônh biren	-1
Did I just hear Donald Trump say understanded	-1
Biden: It's all Trumps fault. - I am going to do stuff. - Trump is no good. Trump: It's not my fault. - We have done stuff. He hasn't done stuff. - Biden is no good.  I saved you one-and-a-half hours	-1
Joe Biden for President 😎	-1
The thing with raising minimum wage is that cost of living goes up like apartments and housing which brings your 15$ hr back to 7-8$ hr again if you do the math.    Also businesses make thousands of dollars a day and pay their employees minimum wage an hour? I can make 20+ an hr doing door dash and Uber eats. That’s the competition, people would rather work for them selves doing that than work for someone else and make minimum wage..	264
Donald trump = sexist, racist homophobic,fascist	-1
Both are corrupt to their teeth and belly taking bribes and lying nobody is innocent here.	-1

Трамп исправлял ошибки Барака Обамы, ему не хватило времени,  все  расовые конфликты были просто так? Нет, это все подстроено конкурентами, грязная игра, но люди хотят верить в добро, но добра не будет, Трамп единственный человек который вел страну к миру и развитию, переделывая политику прошлого, но увы и ах, Америка вновь встаёт на путь самоуничтожения... Гражданам Америки: Россия с вами, какие бы беды не принес Байден. Да поможет вам Бог.	11
Biden is a lier!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣lier!	-1
Trump is scared to go to jail Yes best comedy	-1
If Biden wins, american people will sufer later. Biden is not going to help  Amerca in nothing. He just wanted to take peoples freedom.	-1
"1:15:45 The mediator is entirely one-sided - whenever the conversation goes over-time, she constantly tries to stop Donald Trump from over-speaking by saying ""we need to move on,"" but when Joe Biden joins in, she never attempts to interject even when he's talking for twice as longer and slower. Each and every time the convo goes over-time, you'll notice her do this."	-1
what donald trump did at the end of the debate by not waving back from Biden is example that 40 to 47% of American are not polite and racist!!! I met two of them at my country when they travel to Mount Ijen, and they look really racist and not polite!!	-1

Прилетает Байден в Берлин(столица ФРГ). У трапа его встречает почетный караул с оркестром. Но  Джо Байден, ни на что не отвлекаясь, деловито подходит к клумбе, кладет в карман горсть земли, возвращается в самолет и отбывает на родину. После этого  Госдеп посылает в Германию следующую ноту: «Приносим извинения за случившееся недоразумение. Вместо программы Мира в главу страны была заложена программа Лунохода».	11
33:36 Biden: president trump is xenophobic but not because he closed down the borders early...   Proceeds to never tell us how the president is xenophobic 🙄	-1
So hes been under audit for 20 years. Lmao what a douche bag	-1

Neither candidate is perfect, but idk how you can listen to Biden and believe that he would make a competent president I just don’t. A career politician who has achieved nothing and is clearly mentally diminished in his old age. The world has really turned upside down. It no longer makes sense if it ever did.	-1

Biden to win. Trump is good too. But Biden seems fairer to all races and religions. So Biden R.E.M.? I gave you 7000 votes form USA all my family friends doctors auntie uncles. 7000 votes for you I gave. So I hope you stick to your word pls. And when you become president off the USA 🇺🇸 (which I no you will) we Muslims are praying for you. That you help all when in need and be fair in affairs. All affairs. Give everybody a house like gaddafi did before he housed himself and his parents. Try too support all humanity free electricity like gaddafi did. Free university education etc like gaddafi In libya 🇱🇾 did. And all the other things that he did and more.tgats a real president a man who is man off the state. Should act like. Regardless off the situation. Your inn it to win it. Gracias W sallam Adios	-1

Trump actually thinks people living right next to refineries, in dirt-poor neighborhoods, are making tons of money because they work at the refinery? You've got to be kidding me.  People who make good money sure as hell don't live in places like that.  I lived in a place just like that when I was a kid.  There was a Conoco refinery across the street. The soil, air, and water were polluted and it smelled awful. They finally bought out the neighborhood (we got almost nothing) and bulldozed it, along with the nearby elementary school. The place is now a park and there's still an orange and yellow runoff creek running around the property.	-1

"I'm from Bulgaria. First question asked.Trump goes for the facts. Joe goes for the mass. Me: You elected a president that was ""no good"" and now you're going for more?! I actually think now that people in a free country can be ruled with such an ease. You're dumbasses man, so brainwashed with everything, no critical thinking. Come on man you're really that ignorant and faded?! I'm predicting that you'll go down with so much speed... And the worst is that even then you'll find someone to blame... It's never you. Come on people, stop dividing and think just one time. Just one. Fuck who runs for president. Think for YOU dumb ass mf, you're supposed to be a part of the ""greatest"" country in the world.  Look at you. Just look at you you defensive ""oh but this, but that"" people. You're pathetic. Lame nation."	-1

l am one of the Victims. At first, the software seemed to be really professional and authentic. I found many favourable reviews about its performance and delivered results. So, I decided to invest in it and try to achieve success in the online trading sphere. Soon, I realized that the software was swallowing all my investments. Brokers are nothing more than a dangerous and fraudulent platform. I invested over $ 140,000 and couldn't withdraw my money, months passed and still nothing.

Cure can not be worse than problem itself.                               - TRUMP so he does make sence every, now and then.	39
Every time Trump tries to respond, she speaks over him telling him we have to move on or we have a lot of questions. Even when she says he has 30 seconds, she doesn't give it to him. She cuts it short saying we have to move on. She is speaking over him so people won't hear what he is saying. When Biden wants to respond, she doesn't interrupt at all and gives him the time he needs.	91

Well, we were in lock down in the beginning in April and I can say the city is here running as it was before except tourism, unfortunately we cannot influence other countries and their rates and travel restrictions..Yes it meant we had to wear masks and we still do and I personally can say Ive never been less sick ( not even a cold). All the shops and restaurants have capacity limit, now they implanted plexiglass so restaurants can accommodate more people. UAE specifically Dubai was strict with a few simple rules which really helped the country to recover. I am very grateful to be here during this difficult time.	-1

The way that Joe Bidden debate was like childish people. He blamed blamed over and over. Like child blaming something. thats my observation. Even though i am not native american. I really enjoyed this debation.	-1
31:13 “ other countries, particularly Europe” Europe is not a country, silly	-1
It's all one big pantomime	-1
Trump destroyed Biden...i think hes an idiot but hes a good idiot. I rather have trump than a guy who is trying to use politics and power of presidency to raise up taxes among other things...Trump has done a great economic job btw...the best in years. And btw that bitch was on the side of Biden	-1
36:21 best thing trump has said  hate the man but very true	-1
Biden: Anyone who is responsible for those deaths should not remain as president. Me: Your still like, half responsible...    That one kid who got an A+ from cheating: I take FULL responsibility!        Biden: These masks WILL keep us safe! Me: *wears a mask like all day when going anywhere* Still me: * Gets something and doctors say it's going into a fever*  Me AGAIN: Ok, that's a lie     32:37  Trump: blah blah blah Biden Mind: Oh geez, he's got the truth out...    Ok, I'm gonna stop the memes and stuff. Sorry if you wanted more.	-1
Biden look like he's about to cry.	-1
the more i listen to this the more I love where i live... im so glad i dont live in america	-1
is it just me? or does leadership include not just trashing the other person? its not: who is the better man, but who doesn't suck the most...	-1
Didn't seem the mediator was bipartisan, she seemed distinctly like she supported Biden. What these people in the media have to remember is that this country elected l'essuyer Trump for a reason, because he was more popular.  We the people don't want to hear your political correctness and want to be anti racist racism while China flushes or country and you help them do it because YOU ARE BRIBED, just like all the backwards dictatorships in Africa and other places China is manipulating.	-1
Can someone get Biden out of this fricken world or should I say joe Biden the idiot	-1

"Trump made vulgar comments about his own DAUGHTER's body, and the Trumpets think that him saying that stuff about his own kid is okay. People say Biden's a pedo, yet Biden seems a LOT smarter than Trump.  Not to mention Trump got COVID after making fun of it and saying it wasn't real, and Biden had pointed that out.  Trump is LGBTphobic, he took away healthcare rights for my fellow LGBTQ+ people, telling doctors they have all rights to deny LGBTQ+ people medical care. Biden actually CARES about our community.  Trump has called military people ""losers"" as well... yet they fight for this heartless, lie-filled world.   All the Trumpets would then say ""oH mY gOd FaKe NeWs He NeVeR sAiD aNy Of ThAt!!"" FACT CHECKS, PEOPLE. FACT CHECKS.  Another thing Trump keeps doing! EVERY TIME someone else is trying to say or ask something, HE INTERRUPTS. He clearly is a rude pig."	-1

Biden's victory is the biggest underdog story in history. He was counted out many times even during the primaries, and no one in the Republican quarter believed he would stand a chance against Trump. Trump called him the worst candidate in history. Well, Trump was beaten but that very candidate.	-1

I wonder if America will ever get a president that the whole country, or at least majority will back and support. It's always that half the country hates the president. Is it United States of America, or Divided States of America? Come on americans. Elect someone sensible that can bring your country together. No wonder you're always on a brink of civil war, it's almost like 2 different countries in one.	-1

It appears my prediction I made awhile ago is coming true:  1. Trump will declare victory on or soon after November 3rd if the early votes indicate so. It is well known that Democrats are more in tune with CDC guidelines than Republicans so Republicans will show up more on election day whereas Democrats will vote more by mail 2. Trump will declare the votes by the American people by mail fraudulent 3. Trump will defy the election results when the tally of in person and mail is finalized...if Biden wins 4. Trump, by defying, will want to push it to the Supreme Court where our election will be decided by the court by a 6 to 3 conservative majority rather than the people. It will be the 2nd time, along with Bush, that the court decided a presidential election 5. Trump will cause a constitutional crises and put his divisive presidency on steroids  1 & 2 have already happened. The infancy of #4 is beginning as well...although it appears now that it probably will never get to the Supreme Court as state courts are denouncing trumps attempts to thwart democracy. Trump thinks he should be the one to certify himself the winner rather than our American due process on elections.  I've never seen anything like it. We've seen candidates contest close elections in certain states...but usually once the votes are tallied. This is much worse than the one other example by another Republican in 2000.  So Trump is suing Democratic districts to stop the vote count of the American people. How corrupt is that.  We are seeing why this president needs to be replaced. He is acting somewhat like a despot. If you don't respect the American system then how can you be American? If you don't respect the American people's voice/choice?  Let's truly hope 3, 4, 5 never occur.   I also forgot to outline #6. Trump will never show any of the grace or dignity of past presidents who have graciously conceded the presidency to the choice of the people.  Oh, and #7. Trump will not arrange a transition team for the new president.  Spiteful and arrogant. This outgoing presidents moniker	-1
American : the presidential debate The rest of the word : where are the popcorn  and the 3d glasses	-1
"so disgusting to hear biden about opening the country with all the ""resources"" he claims are needed like social distancing and plexiglas etc...this is not the life we want to live, old people die, its natures way of balancing itself, DEAL WITH IT"	-1
America is just one cursed land for the reason of how they obtained in, it doesn’t matter who they vote for, the outcome always turns out to be the same. I’m not a fan of either Trump or Biden but some of you people need to stop being so easily influenced by the media. People think Biden will be the ‘United States Saviour’ but take a look at this fact, every democrat that has been in office has started a war, Trump was crazy but he’s just a twitter gangster only using threats, he’s a bluffer. Biden and his democrat friend answer to anything is war. Like I said, the USA is a cursed land by the Native Americans, we will never forget and I will always teach my children the truth and tell them what America did to the Native Americans is what their friends Israel is doing to Palestine right now. God know best and I leave it with him to deal with the evil around the world. America who ever president will be just know you will still feel the karma for this 👉🏽 https://davidswanson.org/warlist/	-1

Even an ordinary person in a country in the Middle East has found that the Democrats have stolen the American people's vote and replaced it with a fraudulent one in favor of Joe Biden, which will tarnish their reputation in the US Federal Court and the US Supreme Court.  They spent to make this fraud real, and because Mr. Trump found out, they delayed the vote count to make it look normal.	-1

I wish more people would actually take the time to listen to this debate.

Trump ain't perfect, but he is a capable president.	-1

Trump VS Common sense, please let the Opposite win!	-1
I never, ever watch this bullshit before the votes are cast. Zero party representation other than Democrat and Republican. Extremist propaganda from the hosts - they're claiming 'breaking news' and presuppositions of international issues, as well as framing one of the candidates below the other. And ultimately, whichever of them 'wins' in a completely rigged voting system...the deep state runs the country anyway. So what difference does it make whether it's one old, right-wing asshole or the other?! A complete carcrash, at every possible level. And the people who believe any of it are infinitely retarded.	-1
Trump blames china just like modi blames nehru😅	-1

"Biden is old man out of his mind. If nobody voted for Biden, it doesn't mean that Russia and China want to ""spoil"" the elections. They don't care. And second, Biden is talking about some kind of nonsense, if only the people would believe him and overthrow Trump."	-1

This is realy *entertaining*	-1
Who is the *impostor* ?	2
"Covid-19 was indirect election interference. Democrats vote more via mail in ballots, as they put more faith in the dangers of Covid/government health institutions. Republicans are more likely to vote in person bc Trump downplayed mail in voting as a scam and they listened. Hence if covid didn't happen, 1. the economy and people's state of mind toward Trump would be a lot better, 2. the election would be more decided by in person voting (less baised method). Now yes maybe covid was accidental, but then again if you wanted to remove Trump covid-19 is covert way of doing it. Trump wants the USA to maintain economic/political status quo, the 1% wants to globalize the world to a central government, centered on China. When you are wealthy (either leftist or on the right) and powerful... social-economic engineering is a great past time. Do wealthy (the 1%) people really care for the poor and the minority? or do they social engineer them to hedge up on power and wealth. This has always been a world of the haves and the have nots. The haves are afraid of trump bc he wants to give the have nots a chance, the haves preach equality but only if it fits their system/ideology. Its not Biden i'm worried about, it's the people he will put in lofty positions to set america into their new world order of systematic equality under their control.   I want equality under our (WE THE PEOPLE) control. The HAVE NOTS should govern the HAVE NOTS. If you have wealth, good for you, but GTF out of politics. wealth shouldn't be the currency of politics/governance. Good ideas and character should be, the everyday man/women knows best for their community. All politicians should only serve 1 term, career politics is why America is so divided. We need high turn around so ideas stay fresh and people don't get too comfy in power, which reduces corruption. We need Civics and community involvement in our elected officials. We have become so distracted or apathetic to the system that controls our lives. If you want to change America for the better don't just vote party line, actual be involved and fulfill the ""governance by the people and for the people"". The people are not represented well by the 1% or career politicians."	-1

"You don't have to be a conspiracy wacko to see, America has a deep state issue going on. Look around and open your eyes. see the media mafia monopoly, the diversionary tactics of plan-demic, all of a sudden government press release ufo sightings, terrorists, active shooting, funded organized race riots, gender politics, Epstein Lolita express politician/ celebrity pedophile island/ ""billionaire suicide"". social media internet censorship. Saturated occult entertainment industry ""comics, movies, videogames, media, tv shows, music indoctrination propaganda,"" hidden in plain sight secret society public symbolism affiliated with antiquated pagan occult religion. race and fem liberty is just a subterfuge for the brainless cows, or the soulless, spineless media puppets spewing diarrheic rambling to the contrary. the poll results were always subject to corruption.

They really need to close the Country and The fact that i agree with Joe. Look. i may not Be an american. Im a filipino and Just by the fact that im minding somebody's country and all that. But tbh i just wanna help and Give my Opinion. and yes. There may be Kids dying because of Suicide. but just by the fact that more Kids are dying because of Corona Virus. and Mostly alot of People Go to school with Corona. So It Infects the Kids and the Parents... and If you were trump.. Would You let alot of People Die and Lose alot of people?. For me.

And they still get money to stay afloat...just for 2 months or 3 which will allow scientists to come with a real vaccine	-1

Would you please vote 🗳 for Donald Trump ❤️🙏	-1
Ok now if what trump saying is true why is gov..saying it might be another shutdown.....and its been many more cases meaning a rise.......	-1
1st Wrong thing that happened...  The debate should have started with a shake of hands.  2nd wrong thing.. Before asking them how they can cure covid, they must have first listen to the legit front liners and medical heroes whom sacrificed their lives putting serious emphasis first on what they have to say before they both provide their best supporting follow up answers.  3rd.. when they had seen problems and had a piece of mind from each individual errors from the start why did they not voice it then and started to just say them now?  As if wanting the people to get involve in criticisms from the past yet not involving the public when the error could have been fixed by open speeches, meetings, sincere forums and good council?  Lastly, when they both as a team have tried and did not even work out.. is it not yet another shallow reasoning and misdirection of the blind public for them to reason out that it was because of who was president and who was vice?   Tsk..	-1

Donald Trump: my username on Fortnite is Imthebest123, I got every single skin - all of them and I never lose. Not ever, ask my mother. All I ever do is win, everything has to go my way. My pride matters, before the people! Biden never stood a chance, shattered his delusion of grandeur. The people love me so much, I'll have to start doing live streams and tossing out stimulus checks to my lucky viewers. Power to the sheep.	-1
what biden plan on china ?	-1
Trump and Biden fight so much, that if a piece of poop was going to get them votes, they'd fight over it.	-1

Biden wants a wwlll or WTF he is saying about IRAN N Korea Russia and China.	-1
not a biden or trump supporter and i dont like politics... i think both candidates are idiots,  but if you actually dont believe this was a completely corrupt election from the democrats  you're a complete fucking moron.  1) 140,000 mail in votes found at 4:30am and 100% for biden. do you actually beleive that out of 140,000 Votes of mail in ballots. EVERY SINGLE one was for biden? NOT EVEN 1 for trump? lmfaoooo!  2)  200,000 mail in votes found at 5:00am and ALL were for biden. Not even 1 for trump! LMFAO!  3) 1Million mail in ballots found in Pennsylvania (EVERY SINGLE ONE FOR BIDEN). yup, not 1 single one for trump.   Total = 1.34million Votes were mysteriously found in the middle of the night, and NOT One single one for trump? LMFAO!!!!!   NOT EVEN ONE? LMFAOOOO	-1

The United States doesn't own it's own tax dollars.  The Federal Reserve bank is a private bank (which the United states owns about 33%) and every government we elect still has to requisition (or ask permission) for funds from the Fed.  Strange right?   WHY DO OUR TAX DOLLARS GO TO A PRIVATE BANK?   I love it here just don't believe the US or it's leaders have any real power outside the US.  The masquerade of democracy is important to keep the world distracted from our painful truth:  We're busy fighting ourselves (ALL THE TIME) about left or right when the truth is WHAT's the DIFFERENCE if our tax dollars are going to a private bank(?).  I pay taxes just to be anarchy (paradox of the USA).	-1
Well,	193
I would like to ask Donald Trump why he didn't ask Putin to do the counting? Sadly that great war hero John Mccain is no longer with us, so I'll ask a question on his behalf. Who is the loser now Donald? This is my tribute to Donald……Hope you like it. Morrissey does. https://youtu.be/5t5SooJ-p2g	-1

Joe Biden Is best in the world	-1
Biden: – Mainstream politics, nothing fancy or particularly ingenious – Some potential scandals – Potentially sometimes misrepresenting information – Not always speaking entirely clearly, both in meaning and in the speech itself – Basic adult level logic, thinking and manners  The sad thing is, in respect to each of these points he is by far the better option here...	-1
Ugh this is not an presidential debate it's an meme	-1

I'm not American. I hope trump is still the president. Trump really tries to protect and change your country. The whole world understood what Trump was trying to do. But you guys don't ...	-1
Trump never changed his way, always been straight and forward. This Biden guy is defenetly a switch sides for the one who is paying. I can bet on it in the first 6 months of the election of Biden, USA is going to start a war somewhere around the globe just to release the military budget to push the economy out of this C19 crisis. While Trump is pushing USA out of NATO and stopping the nonsense wars. Always look into what people do without elections before voting for them during the elections.	-1

"Woe to the US if Biden wins! Poor Americans without discernment did not understand that Biden is a Marxist ... and Marxism is actually Satanism! Marx, the founder of communism, was a Satanist! You won't see that in the media bought almost entirely by the communists (Lucifer's servants)! US falls into the hands of a huge satanic octopus! ********* The Satan theme is most explicitly set forth in Marx's ""The Fiddler,"" dedicated to his father:  See this sword? the Prince of darkness Sold it to me.  And  With Satan I have struck MY DEAL, He chalks the signs, beats time for me I play the death march fast and free. Here is a classical expression of Satan's supposed reason for hating, and rebelling against, God. In another poem, Marx writes of his triumph after he shall have destroyed God's created world:  Then I will be able to walk triumphantly, Like a god, through the ruins of their kingdom. Every word of mine is fire and action. My breast is equal to that of the Creator.  And in his poem ""Invocation of One in Despair"" Marx writes,  I shall build my throne high overhead Cold, tremendous shall its summit be. For its bulwark — superstitious dread For its marshal — blackest agony.  ...and Satan speaking through his (Marx) mouth:  … Worlds I would destroy forever, Since I can create no world; Since my call they notice never… ********* Particularly instructive is Marx's lengthy, unfinished poetic drama of this youthful period, Oulanem, A Tragedy. In the course of this drama his hero, Oulanem, delivers a remarkable soliloquy, pouring out sustained invective, a hatred of the world and of mankind, a hatred of creation and a threat and vision of total world destruction.  Thus Oulanem pours out his vials of wrath:  … I shall howl gigantic curses on mankind: Ha! Eternity! She is an eternal grief … Ourselves being clockwork, blindly mechanical, Made to be the foul-calendars of Time and Space, Having no purpose save to happen, to be ruined, So that there shall be something to ruin … If there is a something which devours, I'll leap within it, though I bring the world to ruins- The world which bulks between me and the Abyss I will smash to pieces with my enduring curses. I'll throw my arms around its harsh reality: Embracing me, the world will dumbly pass away, And then sink down to utter nothingness, Perished, with no existence — that would be really living!  And  … the leaden world holds us fast, And we are chained, shattered, empty, frightened, Eternally chained to this marble block of Being … and we — We are the apes of a cold God. ********* Marx expressed both his megalomania and his enormous thirst for destruction:  Heaven I would comprehend I would draw the world to me; Living, hating, I intend That my star shine brilliantly …"	-1

Even if China is at fault..as a leader of country, he should take immediate steps to stop the virus from spreading and encourage Americans to use mask n take precautions. N not keep blaming and blaming repeatedly on China. Pushing responsibility to China will not help to save the nation life.	-1
Trump looks like and acts like a spoiled brat one big baby gets big fat hands going when he talks	-1
Frankly I don’t think COVID19 is from Wuhan, China. From data shown America has 9 over million ppl infected whereas China has only 86 thousands. It’s approximately 110 times more than China. It’s more logical that Americans that spread virus in China instead. I don’t have intention to accusing any countries. Just Mr Trump’s statement doesn’t correspond with the data. 🤷🏼‍♀️	-1
I think Trump will do more good then Biden for usa	-1

Red kinda sus....	169
Totally agree with Biden. The UK have done exactly that with test and trace, covid kits, visors and screens in restaurants, with table service or order on apps only. Cannot ignore that you have to find a new normal when responding to covid. You can't just open everything up again and let everyone go on like they did before. You must take precautions.	-1
Guys who won?	50
Trump is nice	232
Why are people joking? This is very important so that we won't be overwhelmed if biden is president then in Vietnam we will have to learn Chinese but learning Chinese is a terrible thing. to our country because someone from China escaped to our country and smeared a lot of saliva making people infected with corona virus	-1

MASS DEMOCRAT VOTER FRAUD ! Michigan video evidence of people bringing in water coolers & suitcases at 4:30am (after close) mass reports of sharpies being given to Trump supporters. The truth is out there for everyone to research ! Ballots with birth dates in 1900 ..  plenty of evidence !	-1
“We’ll have to move on.” Repeated how many times, but Trump keeps on talking. Joe, to his credit, stops way before she says it.	238
All joe biden needs is his house his family and his job, to do well. Trump, is only doing well because all needs is to be in charge of every police and motary unit and every building in every city. And lots of other power tripping necessities.	-1

President Trump have reason on closing everything in the country is causing only negative impact in everything, like people cant advance in nothing. Some country have the same population of so much state in the US and they don't have social distance and obligation to wearing a mask, so the result is people are not infected, some of them are sick during one or two weeks, but there is a very low percentage of people who have all of the symptoms of Covid-19. This is hilarious to close everything and to take some measures who don't help the US because the virus is changing more rapidly then the people who try to find a vaccine in some weeks. The time that every biologist, scientist and every people in medicine takes to find a valuable vaccine is useless cause the virus is evolving more rapidly that everyone who put too much hours in this research. ( the time that they takes for that is enough to said we gonna have a new form of the virus in three month and less).	-1
Biden will be another muppet controlled by who is running this pandemic game!! not saying that Trump is great but between the two is the only one that will do things using his own head rather than taking instructions from the central bank...the only one making huge profits now!! that's my opinion...many would disagree but that's the way I see things!!	-1
Dear Americans,  Being an indian, I want to know that who is genuine among two.  And who will make America proud in future?	-1

Every time Trump is asked a question based on his previous policies, he immediately diffuses responsibility and blames the previous president and government and straw mans them to make them look bad. For instance, when Trump is asked about his immigration policy resulting in 500 kids being parentless, instead of addressing the flaws in his policy, he immediately introduces 'cages' into the argument that the previous president allegedly built. He says things without any proof and has no basis for argument because he is a lazy president who has not done anything beneficial and who doesn't take responsibilities for anything (or lack thereof). Biden is evidently the better president here and he wants to serve everyone, unlike Trump who wants to serve the rich and powerful and perpetuate a system that disenfranchises the working class and people of colour!!!	-1
and one of these two will be your next president.... good luck !	-1
I feel bad about trump. This guy (Biden) is repeating the same phrase.	-1

"Questoion 1 concerns covid 19. Are we electing doctors? 30 seconds of bidens introduction he introduces his covid 19 action by condensendingly suggesting ""anyone responsible for all the covid 19 deaths should not be president of the United states"".  Mr. DONALD TRUMP, you have my full support 100%, I see right through this entire agenda. Stay strong. Everyone who has your back trump, were all impressed with your patients and continued efforts to make America great again. And we all feel for you Mr Trump having these nonesencial brainless caddy drama setbacks which undermined your potential.  Sir, your our only hope for a more promising future. Prayers for Mr Donald Trump and his lovely supporting family and voters."	-1
I think Biden was great. Mind you he’s openly spoke about having a stutter so he has to talk slower to not stutter. Doesn’t mean he’s not intelligent 😑 the fact that he can stand in front of millions of ppl/ the world and speak knowing he has a speech impediment but is still willing to do it to stand up for the American ppl is just one example of why he is a leader. It is an incredibly hard thing to do	-1

BIDEN hammered Trump --- because he is a man with a plan and he talks truth ... Trump just spews what he thinks people want to hear and he makes everything up -- he has no plan - he is about ego and not about the American people it's very easy to see.	-1
"Biden: "" you said you were Abraham Lincoln. Trump: ""No I didn't, I said I have done more for the black community than anyone else since Abraham Lincoln"".  Me: "" Bro if Biden gets in office with the attention span he has now where in trouble""  He can't even keep a mental note of his opponents last spoken words.......   They know who's going to be innogarated beforehand..... Voting is pointless...... How do you know for sure that your vote made a difference in the count of an election..... Once again...... HOW DO YOU KNOW...  not because you went/registered to vote or the polls on the internet displays the amount of ppl who voted for what party.  HOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR VOTE COUNTED TOWARD ANYTHING!!!!!  #MATRIX  #RELOADED"	-1

Not till this election and I doubt we will ever return to that party since we look back on how today's party leaders do lie and cheat. That fact has never been so true and obvious since this election was and has been stolen.  For the goodness of all  let's hope there's a complete and total recount of all the votes and let all Americans see what honesty means from today's highest democrats that may wind up on top, we all will be feeling sorry once they are in the house.	-1

Donald Trump even said ""drink bleach to stop corona"" Don't do that cause bleach is deadly please vote Joe Biden he has more commen sense."	-1
"I find it strange how Biden said ""We are learning to die WITH it"" but that could mean that the person had died from something else for example a heart attack but they had covid. So that means that the number of coronavirus deaths are fake(most of them). This means that people who died from a car crash but they had covid will be added to the numbers. #TRUMP!. Also people out there who vote for Biden because he is catholic your wrong. He agrees with Abortion and trump doesn't and Abortion is one of the 5 sins were heaven cries"	-1
I haven't really watched this. But I just wanted to say something. I dont know anybody who is stupid enough to vote for Biden. Only a complete democratic idiot would do that. Not saying I am smarter or anything. It's just that I am smart enough to not vote for Biden. He already has amnesia or something. We need a righteous smart president.

Trump is correct most 99.9 percent people can recover from this scamdemic, but unfortunately covid  is being used as a scapegoat.

"PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;""  Ro 3:10 ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:""  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 ""For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.""  Ro 5:8 ""But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.""  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 ""that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.""  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism...."	-1

"At the end of the day, every politician plays the game to get your votes. Regardless of anything they tell you or promise you, the president only has as much power as they are allowed, which is never as much as they want you to believe. From one American to another, regardless of where your political loyalties lie, please don't put the entirety of your hope and faith into any president to solve every problem, whether they're red, blue, or turquoise. You will always be let down. And never, ever let some people in a suit on a stage bickering for position divide you from your fellow citizens--there is so much division in these ""united states"" that it's almost silly to call us united anymore. At the end of the day, we're all in this battle together. No one should hate another person or dissociate with them entirely because they have a different political opinion. We can never work together without coming together--sharing ideas, having discussions, and being open-minded and willing to listen and discuss rather than argue and fight."	-1

I don't understand every time Joe Biden speaks Donald Trump got to open his piehole and say something real quick and comment they want to move on to the next segment the next category he keeps opening his mouth and, keeps interrupting I think Donald Trump is arrogant and I think he's a damn liar and I don't think he knows what the hell he's doing I think he's trying to ruin our country because the small businesses are going out of business people are losing their jobs businesses are closing and Donald Trump to me doesn't seem like he cares about America. The way Joe by does Joe Biden's Topix go into more detail they have a more functionality that goes in-depth of what he wants to do and turn our country in the right direction by saying he wants the coronavirus and he wants people to have jobs again to create jobs he wants people to buy American Products you never hear Donald Trump saying people need to buy American Products you never hear Donald Trump say he has a plan Donald Trump wants to cut Obamacare and you never hear him say he has a plan for medical what are people supposed to do for healthcare he never said he had healthcare plan that's just stupid and ludicrous he just beating around the bush and grasping at straws you don't know what the hell he's singing he's going to ruin this country worse because it's already going to hell in my book he is trying to prove Donald Trump but I think Joe Biden is the better president. For this problem and everything else we are facing in the United States today	-1

I find it very interesting how many people are anti-Trump in the comment section... I suggest you stop listening to biased media alone and actually look at statistics during Trump's presidency. That might change your mind.	-1
Lol it seems like they r playing among us and trump is the imposter and he blames Biden and Biden goes like no I’m crewmate 😂	-1

Not Trump because:  Trump wants to ban Marriage equality (Gay/Lesbian marriages) Wants to take away women rights (Making abortion illegal, If you don’t know what that means it means if a pregnant woman wants to not have a baby, she can Kill it when it’s not fully developed, meaning it’s not living) Trump wants to separate Mexicans from Americans (Built a wall)  Trump almost started world war 3 Trump is separated Kids from their parents and keeping them in cages. Trump mocked a news reporter with disability. Trump called Hispanics Drug dealers, criminals, and R*pists. Told everyone if they drank bleach They would cover from Corona Virus. Trump r*ped 53 people (He has Allegations if you don’t believe me) Said he could get any woman he wants because of his money. Said he would date he daughter if she wasn’t actually his daughter. Wants to ban Obama Care and People STILL vote for him?!  I can keep going but let’s move on  Biden Because:  Loves Gay/Lesbian marriage and isn’t against it. Isn’t Racist and accepts all races. Wants to take down the wall. Wants to bring back Obama care and make it Bigger. Has good plans to make Corona better. Has no attitude. Literally at the end of the debate he said goodbye to trump and he just walked away in Madness.   Those are my reasons for people who know/People who aren’t American!	-1
trump is telling the truth about the corona virus ...i was infected but cured with no any medicine at all its just my immune sustem hes trying you people to figure out that rhis world pandemic is a world scam....but people who got not infected is so ignorant....and those who got the virus and dies doesnt have strong immune system or they have other deseas thats het them worst	-1

I am not a trump supporter but he needs to win this election otherwise Biden will roll out evil agendas that will destroy the light that there is left. I'd rather a moldy piece of bread win but Biden will destroy everything.	-1

I’m not watching this because of the debate. I’m watching this because of entertainment.	-1

Trump cutting the woman out is absolutely disrespectful.	-1
Trump is right to a certain degree but doing it right is what really matters is putting the people first and making sure everyone is safe before going into a situation just don't throw people In Harm's Way because it won't be a country. If you don't do it right and people are going to start dying it defeats the purpose if you can't go to work and be safe if you can't go to school and be safe if you can't step into a store and be safe I agree with Joe what he saying if you're going to do it do it right	-1
i absolutely hate trump but his way of dealing with the virus is better than bidens in my opinion	-1

Joe Biden is demential, and his vice president won't control for sht. The dictature states sees this as an oppurtunity to start a war against USA. So it's all up to Americas people to vote right. If you want a tough leader with a brain or not. Sorry if that sounded offensive but we never know if a war will burst out.	-1

trump IS the tremendous abuse	-1
I know that it’s a hard request but anyone can write all debate below here in the comments please?	-1
Donald Trump is acting too rude to the reporters who are doing the invew with him too	-1
there is an election going on right now and people are small minded enough and not educated correctly that they are voting for Joe biden, who lets riots happen freely, and Donald Trump stops them whenever possible, and Joe Biden is a supporter of abortion, which regardless of what anyone comments, or the hate i get from this, abortion is the killing of a baby. If you actualy look it up on articles and other things online, you can find out that most abortions take place after the baby is not a what they like to call ''fetus'' anymore, its a baby with arms, legs, feet, and a head. But everyone doesn't like hearing that because its the truth, and they want to make it seem okay to keep doing what they are doing. Hate me for being a Trump supporter, Hate me for being against anarchism,  Hate me for being against abortion, Hate me for saying its wrong to have kis that are just 5 years old come on tv shows, and other videos an talk about what men they find attractive, when they have barely just got out of pre-school. I speak truth and you should too. Vote for Trump 2020. And if you need further proof about how Joe Biden wouldn't be a good fit for our country,, please take the time and watch this.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcAhDPF5-_E	-1

Do you think them more sophisticated and classy presidents, prime ministers, Queens and Kings are different at the core? It's all corrupt. Every person in power has shady businesses. Every person in power shakes hands with demons and I'm saying that metaphorically. When you look at these two men without overthinking who do you choose? Don't listen to what they say just look into their eyes. Who do you choose?	-1

Biden touched the front of his mask and his face 😂😂😂😂	-1
Trump has brain! After all this time I have been having doubts for what is being showed on the media about Trump. Now it is so obvious that Biden is not being factual in every answer he did. He is an average type of a person who seeks failure and blaim others. Aside from it he can't bring back the life of  the people who died of corona( Covid, is not fatal, and people who died from it, were mostly already were suffering from serious illness for probably years or months before they got infected). He keeps blaming trump and his administration for something they did not created. Now I know for sure Biden is not the answer for a  better America.	-1

its so funny the fact trumps face is literally orange and his hands are white  😳	-1
Funny how our President Trump said in the beginning that we have a vaccine. Then Biden went on to blame trump for these deaths when the Democratic Party funded BLM knowing they would go riot & protest going back home to their families.. like... it was all a plot from these Dems.	-1
"https://youtu.be/WZWRhLW7Y8w TED VERY good tips for this elections..and the importan  ""consesor speech"" to prevent crisis at the streets in this extrem polar elections wich decides the Destiny of the world (should not be like THIS!each nation would be free someday!).

"Ok i like biden but did he just say ""Dont worry all of you teachers out there not that many of you are going to die"" WTF"	262
Anybody thinking that this debate is a little bit personal? Like ffs talk about America, their people, and how to fuckin stop covid getting even worse alright. Why are they just taking shots at each other rather than talking about what's right	-1
"""I take full responsibility. It not my fault, it's chinas fault."" God how did he become the president of Murica 😂🤣. Sounded like a little child when they get caught doing something wrong."	-1

Biden and the media love to play the blame game  but so do I does not mean you should but guess what life does not work in my favor  moderator: what is your plan with those who worry about the children in the school system? Biden: safely open, social distancing, make sure we get help Me: how does this solve anything, and you wanted to keep the economy closed, what? Trump: keeping the schools open helps prevent the economy from collapsing Me: that tells me what I need to know Txs: Facts As soon as Trump states truths about the economy Biden looks down kinda mad at 44:00 25:30-30:00 this is basically Biden trash-talking as payback.	-1

It’s funny how Biden a literal living puppet can say that he will grow the economy with his socialist views. Trump explains exactly what will happen if Biden is elected. 401k’s will be destroyed the stock market will crash and we will go into a very dark and Great Depression all over again. America is not a socialist conservative country. If you vote Biden you have the lowest IQ out of everyone in America.	-1

"""Look at the crime bill, 1994, where you called them 'superpredators,' African Americans are 'superpredators,'"" Trump said. ""And they've never forgotten that.""  This is mostly false. It was Hillary Clinton, then the first lady, who used the word ""superpredator"" to advocate for the 1994 crime bill that Biden co-wrote more than 30 years ago. Biden did warn of ""predators"" in a floor speech in support of his bill, however."	-1

All of this that is happening now is fucking made on purpose. Why the fuck all this shit happend right before the elections and not before or after. Like fucking everything at once. A lot of fucking things are going on and everybody blames trumps. Im not even from america and you idiots poeple trying to vote for biden i swear to you you will want the time to go back to vote for trump.

No matter what side your on, there is no excuse for separating children from their families and keeping human beings in cages. That is inhumane, sickening, and very anti-American.

COVID-19 is a BIOLÓGICAL WEAPON: The objective of this biological weapon (covid-19) is to destroy the economies of the United States and Europe (but especially the economy of the United States). The Chinese dead in Wuhan were inevitable human sacrifices in order to create a perfect alibi for not blaming the Chinese biological weapon program for this pandemic. To carry out this biological attack, the Chinese Communist Party was supported by the WHO and the communist regimes of Cuba and North Korea. On January 1, 2020, Kim Jong Un said “The world will witness a new strategic weapon in the near future.” https://michaelgchandler34blog.wordpress.com/	10

If the Dems win we will go broke and hungry .	-1
There is a double standard and people and the media are against Trump. The democrats brought impeachment proceedings against him for nothing, and in 2016, the then vice president Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to ukraine if the government did not fir the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin; nobody talks about that. Victor Shokin was about to investigate Burisma, Hunter Biden's employer, coincidence, i think not? Why was it ok for Biden to do what Trump was accused of doing? Trumps been adamant about Biden's corrupt dealings and just a few days ago e-mails and a computer belonging to coke head Hunter Biden were seized by the FBI for analysis, thus proving Mr. Trump was correct all along about the Biden's. if biden is elected the country's Second Amendment is in jeopardy along with everything else. Biden is not an intellectual person, but somehow people like him and George Bush get elected.	-1

With Trump as president we’ve been able to provide ventilators to other country’s and save millions of lives. With a Democratic president where all your tax dollars stay within your own country will be one of many, many examples that proves our nation is selfish and ungodly. Supporting abortions and letting prisoners roam free will not help either. With Biden as president, you’re f**n doomed no matter what political party represents your beliefs and ideals.  Hint* At least as a republican you’re able to make your own decisions and it be legal at the same time!!  🇺🇸 🦅✝️	-1

I am going to vote for Biden and this is my rationale: National Security, human rights, justice and fairness are the most important criteria. It is also important how the future president takes action and how honest he is. I think Trump needs to care more about human rights and he should put the principle of America like the right of freedom and human rights in more priority otherwise our society will be in danger. He should not breach international contracts that have been signed and been in place by the previous president as it makes us untrusty and unreliable to our allies and other countries. I know Trump likes the US and he wants to make America great but I think his approach is not right. He does not scientifically approach the problems and I think his approach to Coronavirus could be better than this. Neither one is perfect as we are not perfect but I think Biden is better. I think his approach is more scientific than Trump.	-1

The curve isn't gonna flatten if the civilians are not being told properly what to do nor if internally the US government who is giving out mandates can't work together.	-1
"El COVID-19 es un ARMA BIOLÓGICA: El objetivo de esta arma biológica (covid-19) es destruir las economías de los Estados Unidos y Europa (pero muy especialmente la de los Estados Unidos).  Los chinos muertos en Wuhan fueron sacrificios humanos inevitables para crear una coartada perfecta para no culpar al programa de armas biológicas chino por esta pandemia. Para llevar a cabo este ataque biológico, el Partido Comunista de China contó con el apoyo de la OMS y los regímenes comunistas de Cuba y Corea del Norte (Kim Jong Un).

If you think Trump is bad, Biden is good, this one fact should change your mind.  If not then you are biased / brainwashed.  Biden is under investigation by the FBI and the mainstream media hasn't said a word about it.  If Trump was in this situation it's all you would hear.  24/7.  Nonstop.  They wouldn't even report the damn weather anymore lmao.  IT'S ALL THEY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. If you can't see through this kind of bias and corruption, they are in your head.  Please wake up.	-1

Regardless of how this election turns out today – We Must Always Remember How the MAINSTREAM MEDIA BETRAYED THE TRUST of the AMERICAN PEOPLE when we needed them Most.  They kept us in the dark about Joe Biden likely being compromised by the Chinese Communist Party. It does explain why he was a lone voice praising China while Biden's trade deals were sending Millions of American manufacturing jobs to China.  It also explains why he would not have shut down travel from China during the virus, a decision which could have cost millions of American lives.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zLfBRgeFFo Please God, give our people the Wisdom and Strength to understand what is at stake so that we may save this Christian Nation, the light of the world.  Please allow us the ability to use our free will to delay end times for as long as possible so we have more time to save more souls by accepting Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior assuring their eternities and building Your Kingdom. In Jesus’ Name I Pray this prayer Lord. Amen. May God Bless & Keep You.	-1

Only if they knew the responsibility, only if they knew what exactly they're signing up for. They'll have to answer for every single person in the country! Every single person they have rule over! The rulers of the world, kings, queens, prime ministers, presidents, will be among the first 3 to be questioned by God & the third group of people to enter hell first. Almost every country has pretty much spat in Gods face, breaking his law, making hybrid animals, hybrid plants, tampering with human evolution DNA & countless other things. They'll have to answer for every single person in their country who's broken God's Law.. I feel sorry for them.✌🏻😔	-1

Donald Trump has done so much for black communities. Research Trump's First Step Act, which freed many African-Americans from prison with non-violent offenses. Research Trump's Platinum plan which focuses on boosting black businesses and jobs. Trump's policies benefit EVERYONE economically speaking. Before the Coronavirus lockdowns, poverty was at it's LOWEST LEVEL in the history of the country. Vote for Donald J. TRUMP!!	104

Trump Truck Convoy on Biden's (and other Socialist, Communists) campaigns/organizations are a peaceful-protest (and much more peaceful than the Left) plus it's 100% legal-and-encouraged, and because of Kamala's advice - it won't stop (even after the election) So stick that in your pipe and smoke it...

Is there a version of this with a fact checking? It takes too long to find out whether they are lying or telling the truth.  I immediately notice a number of false claims from Trump, but suspect there is misleading information from both candidates.	-1
Kristen Welker was the lady Trump was bashing before this debate, during the debate he complimented Welker on her duty as moderator.  Being a more mature person than Trump she didn't throwback in his face his smearing of her character.  One of the reasons Trump has worn me out, his childishness he never grew into the office of the Presidency.  She did a fantastic job, the best I've seen, including the 2016 election debates.   -And muting during the 2mins of the 6 topics debate was a big help!  Sending a message to the immature, if you can't control yourself you need outside control!	-1
Biden please stop with democratic crab thinking.	-1
Why does the commentator cut Trump off but not Biden?	-1

Biden is part of the cabal. The evil ones. From the summer of 2017 until today you are going to see how Trump, the NSA, JFK Jnr took down the cabal...aka the evil child traffickers who run the world finances. Trumps opponents have attempted to assassinate Trump on numerous occasions because he is exposing their evil. They are very good at deceit. We have been lied to on a scale that is hard to comprehend. America was sold to the highest bidder by Obama, the Clintons and the Bushes. Soon everything you were told about Obama will prove to be false. Falsified on purpose. We will soon see proof of his ties to the Muslim brotherhood. More than 100,000 arrests will be made. Some for treason and some for high treason. High treason means capital punishment, death penalty.  Obama is part of the Muslim brotherhood.	-1

COVID-19 is a BIOLÓGICAL WEAPON: The objective of this biological weapon (covid-19) is to destroy the economies of the United States and Europe (but especially the economy of the United States). The Chinese dead in Wuhan were inevitable human sacrifices in order to create a perfect alibi for not blaming the Chinese biological weapon program for this pandemic. To carry out this biological attack, the Chinese Communist Party was supported by the WHO and the communist regimes of Cuba (Miguel Diaz Canel) and North Korea. On January 1, 2020, Kim Jong Un said “The world will witness a new strategic weapon in the near future.” https://michaelgchandler34blog.wordpress.com/	10

"August 8, 2019: He tells the Asian & Latino Coalition in Des Moines, Iowa, that 'poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.' He attempted to clear up his statement, adding: 'Wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids — no, I really mean it. But think how we think about it ... mWe think how we're going to dumb it down. They can do anything anybody else can do given a shot.' Later that day he tells a crowd: 'We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts.'   August 9: Biden was accosted by a right-wing Turning Point USA staffer at a rally in Iowa. 'How many genders are there?' He asked. Biden replied: 'There are at least three.' The reporter said, 'What are they?' And Biden responded: 'Don't play games with me, kid.' Biden then shook someone in the crowd's hand before turning back and saying, 'By the way, the first one to come out for marriage was me.'   August 10: Biden says he was VP when the Parkland school shooting took place, even though it occurred in 2018. 'Those kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,' he told a reporter. A campaign official clarified that Biden meant the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, in December 2012.   August 24: Biden mistakes New Hampshire for Vermont. Speaking in Keene, NH, he said: 'I love this place. Look, what's not to like about Vermont in terms of the beauty of it?'   September 2: Biden appears confused about the definition of a magazine for a rifle, telling supporters in Iowa: 'The idea that we don't have elimination of assault type weapons, magazines that can hold multiple bullets in them, it's absolutely mindless.' By definition a magazine holds multiple rounds.   September 25: Biden forgot the name of the last Supreme Court nominee under President Barack Obama on Jimmy Kimmel's show. 'Back when, when they were holding up before Trump got elected, they were holding up, uh, um, the nomination of the president put forward for the Supreme Court,' Biden rambled. 'Merrick Garland,' Kimmel said. 'Merrick Garland, a really fine man,' Biden added.   November 2: Says he's in Ohio when he's in Iowa.   November 20: Biden claimed that he had the backing of the Senate's only black female Senator during a Democratic debate. 'I have more people supporting me in the black community that have vouched for me because they know who I am… The only African-American woman who's ever been elected to the United States Senate.' Senator Kamala Harris corrected him, saying: 'That's not true. The other one is here!'   December 5: He called a voter a 'damn liar' and 'fat' after he asked if his son Hunter earned a job on the board of a Ukrainian gas company as a result of his father's high office. 'You're a damn liar, and that's not true,' Biden snapped at him. 'I'm not sedentary. You want to check my shape, let's do push ups together, let's run, let's do whatever you want to do, let's take an IQ test.' He continued, 'But look, fat, here's the deal.'   February 9, 2020: Biden called a 21-year-old woman a 'lying, dog-faced pony soldier' during a Q&A in New Hampshire. Asked by the economics student Madison Moore about his poor performances in the Iowa caucuses, he asked if she'd ever attended a caucus. Moore said she had and Biden hit back: 'No you haven’t! You’re a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.'   February 24: In South Carolina he said: 'My name's Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate.' During the same speech he claimed to to have worked with Chinese leader 'Deng Xiaoping' on the Paris Climate Accord - Deng died in 1997.   February 25: During the final Democratic debate he claimed that '150 million people have been killed since 2007' by guns. If that were the case, half the American population would be dead. March 1: He calls Fox News host Chris Wallace 'Chuck,' and then claims it was because he'd had a recent interview with NBC's Chuck Todd. March 3: He confused Super Tuesday with 'Super Thursday.' And during the same speech he botched the Declaration of Independence, saying: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created, by the, you know, you know the thing.'   March 4: He confused his wife with his sister on stage at a rally in California. 'By the way, this is my little sister Valerie!' Biden said while grabbing his wife's right hand. 'And I'm Jill's husband,' he went on while reaching for his sister's.   March 9: 'Together, I think we can win back the House,' Biden said before correcting himself. 'We're gonna keep the House, increase it and flip the Senate.'   March 10: Biden pledged to ban the 'AR-14,' (instead of AR-15) when challenged by a worker who accused him of 'trying to diminish our second amendment right and take away our guns.' April: He appeared to forget Barack Obama's name while discussing Russia's annexation of Crimea. 'Because they invaded another country and annexed a significant portion of it called Crimea. He's saying that it was president - my boss - it was his fault.'   May 22: Biden tells radio host Charlmagne the God that 'if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.'   August 31: Speaking at a steel factory in Pittsburgh, he stumbled badly over his words, saying: 'COVID has taken this year, just since the outbreak, has taken more than 100 years. Look, here's, the lives, it's just, it's uh, I mean think about it. More lives this year than any other year for the past 100 years.'   September 15: Biden says that wealthy people were able to stay home during lockdown because 'some black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf.' Speaking to a group of veterans in Tampa, Florida, he said: 'The American public, the blinders have been taken off. They've all of a sudden seen a hell of a lot clearer. 'They're saying: ""Jeez, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf.""'   September 20: Biden said that 200 million had died of coronavirus, confusing a million for a thousand. 'It's estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk,' he said.   September 21: He botches the pledge of allegiance, saying: 'I pledge allegiance to the United States of America, one nation, indivisible, under God, for real.' The correct text is: 'I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'   October 12: He appeared to forget that he ran against Mitt Romney in 2012. 'You may remember,' Biden said when telling reporters he was opposed to Democrats criticizing Amy Coney Barrett's faith, 'I got in trouble when we were running against that senator who was a Mormon, the governor.'   October 24: He tells a virtual meeting: 'We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.'   October 25: He got confused about who is president, calling him, 'George.' Speaking at the 'I Will Vote Concert' Biden said: 'Four more years of George, er, George, er, he - we're going to find ourselves in a position where, if Trump gets elected, we're going to be in a different world.' He was aided by his wife Jill who appeared to mutter 'Trump,' under her breath while Biden struggled for the words."	-1

The problem with this debate is that Trump uses language manipulation techniques to avoid Qs (because he doesn’t have a plan for anything other than his own pocket) and use up his airtime to promote what he’s been doing in comparison to other countries, putting everyone else down to make himself look worthy. It’s an old school trick and it’s childish   I thought Joe Biden was doing the same but then eventually he got around to directly addressing the Q	-1

Obama deported 3 times as many people as Trump...Trump has decreased poverty by 15% down by 4.2 million people, everyone ignores this. The unemployment rate at 3.5% was the lowest in 50 years and 160+ million jobs is the highest its ever been and so was the stock market at 29600 and record deals with china / canada adding to over 2 trillion dollars ......Massive achievements.	-1

Does Trump not realize that all these issues he is blaming in Biden have occurred under his administration. The fact that he has not developed a plan to combat the virus is his fault, not Biden’s, the blue vs. red state mindset is exactly why we haven’t seen improvement.	-1
I cant believe people sit here in the comments and blindly say things without looking anything up. its sad.	-1

COVID-19 is a BIOLÓGICAL WEAPON: The purpose of this biological weapon (covid-19) is to destroy the economies of the United States and Europe (but especially the economy of the United States).  The Chinese dead in Wuhan were inevitable human sacrifices in order to create a perfect alibi for not blaming the Chinese biological weapon program for this pandemic. To carry out this biological attack, the Chinese Communist Party was supported by the WHO and the communist regimes of Cuba and North Korea. On January 1, 2020, Kim Jong Un said “The world will witness a new strategic weapon in the near future.” https://michaelgchandler34blog.wordpress.com/	10

Anyone notice how Biden speaks like a psychopath? We all know Trump lies but why would people vote for Biden if they complain about the way Trump lies? Because the lesser of two evils, right? This is why the NEW WORLD ORDER philosophy will continue after Tuesday. Because you all are brainwashed. Think I’m lying? What’s the difference between liberty, socialism, communism, and Fascism? Can’t answer but feel offended? You’re brainwashed.	-1

Please Anyone still Undecided,  Vote Democratic to keep Democracy Alive! The Repub Party's Hatred for Democracy and Freedom has gotten quite obvious! Look it up and plz read about It. Texas and Georgia are the hardest States to Vote in and if Dems lose both, it will probably be from Voter Suppression in at least one! Huge Lines (taking up to 7 hours to vote) and one drop box per County in places like Houston. Its plainly obvious that the GOP is Severely Corrupt, Malicious and Hates Democracy!	-1

All this vaccinating is a big Business of Biden, Bill and Melinda Gates, Fauci and God knows who else !	-1

I don't like either one of them. But, I have a work permit and Trump wants to get rid of me. So, I guess I'm rooting for Biden but I'm not excited.	-1
None of those two guys are perfect candidate. But Trump is, at least, not pretending to be something he isn't. Campaign which makes biden and clintons around him as saints is ridiculous. Even here in Europe and we are not going to vote as you know. Trump did not start any new war anywhere in the World and that is enough for me. b would do it in the first six months if he is elected, send troops somewhere to occupy some small country and give all local companies to his team, as clintons did before. Use your head, between these two not so great candidates at least choose less evil one, and that's Trump. He is focused on USA. And if the only thing is measures against Covid, well there is at least dozen of other countries with worse situation than it is in USA and they did not change government. It has something to do with discipline, way of living, culture, not only measures ...	-1
Biden blaming Trump for coronavirus xD he would have kept the borders open. This is when you would love to see a parallel universe of Biden being in power and seeing how much worse it would be. He says Trump doesn't have a plan after he just said his plan xD Biden doesn't seem quite there, just repeating left wing rhetoric. Even if I was more left wing I wouldn't vote Biden.	-1
by the way...... how they control the social media (..... who knows WHO ..., but strangely everything is deleted from social media what stands behind Trump) I wouldn't be surprised if YOUTUBE  just delete the positive comments here about Trump!.... as it does nonstop!  Fu..k you Youtube and all bloody people who just don't let people to see the truth !!! How could you vote for a miserable man like Biden who nonstop keeps lie-ing and forcibly hiding the truth !!!!!!! Probably hi has plenty of many to pay ALL social media to do this !!!	-1

Out of USA we all hope for Trump ! cause we know Joe Biden will first destroy USA and than he keep continue his hidden s....it businesses all over he can in the Globe !!!! Bieden is a BIG liar!!!!!	-1

Who won the rounds: (based on how accurately each of them answered the question)     Issue.               Biden          Trump *North Korea*        ✅ *Healthcare*                               ✅ *Minimum wage*                       ✅ (massacred) *Covid -19*              ✅Debatable  *Immigration*                              ✅ *Racism*                  ✅                  *Climate change*                        ✅ *inaugural address* ✅  I think Biden won concerning covid due to his political abilities in sympathy. The American people heard his concern for the families that have lost lives. Although trumps claims that we cannot completely shut down we’re true he did not pander to those who have suffered and therefore I gave the win to Biden.  Biden won North Korea because he was the only one that suggested any caution whatsoever towards the country. Although trumps promises to stay mutual with the country he suggests no concern over the nuclear weapons and didn’t answer what he’s going to do about it.   I think trump won healthcare and here is why. Biden admits Obamacare wasn’t perfect and claims he will make modifications to the plan despite the harm it’s done. He claims his new plan “Bidencare” will not only create remedies for the damage but also create affordable healthcare for everyone. However this did not sound promising because his arguments for the changes made weren’t necessarily sound and it sounding like Obamacare will basically still be institute. Trump however stated the changes he has made in policies during his term and gave more sustenance to his argument that he will continue to actually make change.   You could say Biden one the racism section because he answered the question correctly of what would you say to colored families and minorities who do not feel safe.  I gave the win to trump for climate change because Biden has said he would ban fracking and in the debate Biden claimed he never made such promises. Even if you ignore what trump said to Biden during this discussion Biden still stumbled on this section a lot, and sounded vague as to what he would actually do in regards to cutbacks made to oil industries and fossil fuels.   The immigration could go either way. But both spoke some truth in pricking the other candidate with past mistakes but ultimately I recorded the win based on what each of them said they  would do or have done. Trump won because he actually stated what he has done. In ceasing catch and release efforts. Although Biden is telling the truth about Families having been separated he never said what he was going to do.	-1

Sorry, but Michigan is open, has been open since June. the last things to open happened on October. Trump constantly buts in, talking when he's not got the floor. Blatantly arrogant, smug, rude. And dances around the direct questions.	-1
Does anyone else notice how often Joe Biden keeps smiling and shaking his head when Trump talks? Hillary did the exact same thing whenever Trump told the truth about topics. I feel those smiles and shaking their heads is a sign of guilt being pointed out.	-1

Remember to get your friends, family and neighbors to vote IN-PERSON on Election Day, DO NOT vote-by-mail because if you do, there is a chance that someone could STEAL your VOTE (Most likely a democrat.); and would get rid of it, therefore not making your vote counted. So please, vote regardless and if there’s someone you know that wants to vote-by-mail despite how hard you tried to convince them to vote in-person, then be sure to be on the lookout for anyone that might try to steal their vote because their vote is CRUCIAL for this election. So please, just vote no matter what. 🗳 🇺🇸🎉TRUMP 2020! 🎉🇺🇸 🔴RED WAVE INCOMING! 🔴  Also, if you want to use my comment to spread this information, then go ahead. I don’t really care if someone copies my comment, I just want other people to realize why voting-by-mail isn’t really the best way to vote. But, still vote regardless.	-1

When I look to Amerika , exspacialy the United States , more or less united , it is everytime fascinating how stupid some of Trumps Voters are. I mean, I thought your country is a country of freedom , respect , were a dishwasher can become a millionair , you know that amarican dream nonsence.  And I thought that every men and woman have the right to vote the party or person who he or she want. So please can you explain me why some Trump Voters have so much agression in there, why they try to destroi or fear some persons.  https://www.msn.com/de-de/nachrichten/politik/fbi-ermittelt-trump-schmiedet-%C3%A4u%C3%9Ferst-heikle-pl%C3%A4ne-seine-neue-aktion-schockt-usa/ar-BB1aCgF7	-1

SYSTEMS NEEDED TO ELIMINATE COVID 19, A MUST HAVE FOR BUSINESS: Inside door business technology needed against covid 19 and any other: A/C fans that goes down/up in direction to the roof/floor. And A/C fans to pushes the air out from the doors where people go inside/outside Also self heat surfaces technology and complete light sanitizing system, both kills any germ/viruses instantly. Also air sanitizing/filtering/bacteria & virus killer that is connected to all A/C fans working 24/7  And finally blue light virus laser detector to target those who have any germs around their face/hands and body All this systems in place on EVERY LOCAL BUSINESS, plus advanced transparent mask with air intake/filtering WILL DEFINITELY DESTROY THIS AND ANY FUTURE PLANDEMICS. the development of these systems is a must have for every local business and indoor location.

So biden is saying who ever was president now is to blame basically cuz there is no way you  could have had no deaths so thanks Joe it would be all your fault if you were president clearly thats how you know biden is useless	-1
If Biden is so worried about masks, why isn't wearing one?  I don't matter who is President, this virus wouldn't be any different!   Blaming the President Trump for the virus is anal! Biden is being fed his lines as always!  If you watch, you can see Biden is being fed his answers!   Biden is and always has a crook!!!	-1
So how many mor lies have cam out of trumps mouth during this o thats right every word he said is a lie	-1

Okay I have to say that if you send your family or yourself and family over here illegally and your kids get separated from you, however they got here, and they don't have their parents ... how is that America's problem. SEND THEM BACK ... so its okay to send people over illegally and we help them? Kids or not ... you are here without citizenship so u go back. I do not agree with this whole feel sorry for illegal immigration... send them back and tell them to follow the rules because we sure have to.	-1

I am an Indian & started taking interest in US politics since 2016 & I was pretty sure even then that Trump will win now let's see what happens this time in 2020:)	-1
Didnt trump killed general of Iran and was on the brink of a war with them? They are helping Trump now? I am not defending Trump but how come everyone powerful is always conspiring against Americans? Americans can come up with 2 completely different stories that contradicts each other but in there usa will be the good guys and rest of the world bad guys. Thinking oneself  as the best and thinking others as nothing is definition of Narcissism	-1
